2	BREAKING: Indian Pet Startup Petrosia Turns Down $20M Buyout to Stay True to Its Mission – Now Valued at $100 Million	The $100M Underdog Story: Petrosia is Not Just a Pet Marketplace—It’s a Movement\n\nThree months ago, nobody had heard of Petrosia. Today, it's being called "India’s most loved pet startup" by industry insiders, investors, and pet parents alike. With over 100,000 downloads and a booming user base across Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, the brand has redefined how India buys and bonds with its furry companions.\n\nBut beneath the metrics lies a deeper story—one rooted in loyalty, ethics, and an unwavering commitment to animals over algorithms.\n\n\n---\n\nThe Offer That Shook Us: $20 Million and a Catch\n\nIn mid-March, Petrosia received an acquisition offer from a major VC-backed aggregator based in Singapore. The deal? A full buyout for $20 million. For a startup barely out of beta, it sounded unreal. But there was a catch: They wanted to strip out our ethical breeder verification model, eliminate vet support features, and push aggressive monetization—even at the cost of animal welfare.\n\nThe team took less than 48 hours to decline.\n\nAs our founder said in a now-viral LinkedIn post,\n“We’re building a legacy, not a listing. Petrosia was made for pet lovers, not profit-hungry middlemen.”\n\n\n---\n\nThe Petrosia Difference: Tech Meets Heart\n\nWhile most platforms act as mere listing boards, Petrosia is a full-stack pet ecosystem. Buyers don’t just browse—they connect with verified breeders, get access to real-time vet consultations, and even receive puppy vaccination alerts and parenting guides.\n\nSome of the key differentiators that earned investor attention:\n\nEthical Sourcing: Every breeder is KCI-verified and personally screened.\n\nPost-Sale Pet Care: Vet integration, vaccination alerts, health guides.\n\nZero Commission on Puppies Under 2 Months: Our way of discouraging unethical early sales.\n\nBuilt-in Buyer Chatbot & Vet Panel: Instant answers, real advice.\n\nGrowing Marketplace for Pet Essentials: From GPS collars to smart feeders.\n\n\n\n---\n\nWhat's Next: Not Looking for Sharks, But Shepherds\n\nNow valued at $100 million after a quiet angel round and private equity benchmarking, Petrosia is actively seeking angel investors who are pet parents first, businesspeople second.\n\n“We don't want another shark on board. We’re looking for shepherds who understand the value of care,” said the co-founder.\n\n\n---\n\nFinal Bark\n\nIn a world where startups chase exits, Petrosia is chasing ethics.\nIn a world of quick wins, Petrosia is playing the long game.\nThis isn’t just a company—it’s India’s pet revolution.\n\nInvestor or pet lover? Reach out before the next chapter unfolds.\nBecause Petrosia isn’t up for sale. It’s up for something bigger.\n	bootstrapped idea to a $100M pet-tech sensation. But what’s shocking the startup world isn’t the valuation—it’s that the founders rejected a $20M buyout offer from a top VC firm	breaking-indian-pet-startup-petrosia-turns-down-20m-buyout-to-stay-true-to-its-mission-now-valued-at-100-million-8302	[]	7	t	f	2025-04-17 13:56:52.908+00	2025-04-17 12:09:58.316326+00	2025-04-17 13:56:54.524+00	["#BreakingNews #StartupIndia #Petrosia #PetTech #100MillionValuation #EthicalStartup #PetParents #VCRejection #MadeWithLove #NotForSale #IndianStartups #NextUnicorn #InvestInEthics #PetMarketplace #StartupWithHeart"]	0	[]	[]

3	Golden Retriever	Scotland	Sporting	medium	23-24	21.5-22.5	29-34	25-29	10-12	medium	["gold", "light golden", "dark golden", "cream"]	["friendly", "reliable", "intelligent", "kind", "trustworthy"]	4	4	5	5	5	5	4	2	3	2	["Hip and elbow dysplasia", "Cancer (higher than average incidence)", "Heart disease", "Eye disorders"]	The Golden Retriever is a medium to large-sized breed known for its friendly temperament, beautiful golden coat, and reliable nature. Originally bred as hunting companions to retrieve waterfowl, they excel as family pets, therapy dogs, service animals, and in competitive dog sports.	The breed was developed in Scotland in the mid-19th century by Lord Tweedmouth, who wanted to create the perfect gundog suited to the Scottish climate and terrain. He crossed a Yellow Retriever with the now-extinct Tweed Water Spaniel, with later additions of Bloodhound, Irish Setter, and more Tweed Water Spaniel. The breed was first recognized by the Kennel Club in the UK in 1913.	["British/European type - typically darker gold, stockier build", "American type - generally lighter in color and coat, slightly taller", "Canadian type - usually thinner coat, taller and leaner"]	Golden Retrievers have a water-repellent double coat that requires regular grooming to prevent matting and minimize shedding. They remain puppy-like well into adulthood and need plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. They are especially prone to obesity if overfed or under-exercised.	["Their name 'Golden Retriever' wasn't used until 1920", "They have soft mouths, capable of carrying an egg without breaking it", "The oldest known Golden Retriever, 'August,' lived to be 20 years old"]	3	https://res.cloudinary.com/djxv1usyv/image/upload/v1744885895/IMG_8476_pnshzn.jpg	[]	2025-04-09 23:34:36.15354	2025-04-17 10:31:36.383

Originally bred as a working dog for fishermen, Labs excel in various roles, from family companions to service dogs, hunting partners, and search-and-rescue operations.	Labrador Retrievers originated in Newfoundland, Canada, in the 1500s, where they were used by fishermen to retrieve fish that had escaped hooks and to pull in nets. Later, they were brought to England in the 1800s, where they were crossed with other retrievers and further developed as gun dogs. The breed's exceptional retrieving abilities, coupled with their gentle disposition, contributed to their widespread popularity.	["American Labrador (working type) - leaner, more energetic", "English Labrador (show type) - stockier, calmer disposition"]	Labradors have a tendency to gain weight easily, so proper diet and regular exercise are crucial. They also go through a prolonged puppyhood and can be quite rambunctious and mouthy as young dogs, requiring consistent training.	["Labs have a water-resistant double coat", "Their webbed feet make them excellent swimmers", "Black was the only recognized color until yellow and then chocolate were accepted"]	1	https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Labrador-Retriever-MP.jpg	["https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Labrador-Retriever-On-White-01.jpg"]	2025-04-09 23:34:36.076144	2025-04-10 08:36:21.876

Despite their small size, Pomeranians have a bold, confident personality and make lively, engaging companions.	Pomeranians are descended from large sled-pulling Spitz dogs and are named after the Pomerania region in Central Europe (now part of Poland and Germany). Originally weighing around 30 pounds, they were bred down to their current toy size. Queen Victoria's love for the breed in the late 19th century contributed greatly to their popularity and the development of their smaller size.	["Throwback Pomeranians - occasionally, Poms can be significantly larger than the standard", "Teacup Pomeranians - not officially recognized, but bred to be smaller than the standard"]	Pomeranians require regular grooming to maintain their distinctive coat. Despite their small size, they need training and socialization to manage their sometimes assertive personalities. They can be prone to dental issues that require special attention, and their small size makes them vulnerable to injury from rough handling or falls.	["Two Pomeranians survived the sinking of the Titanic in their owners' coats", "Mozart dedicated an aria to his Pomeranian, Pimperl", "Their double coat naturally produces a distinctive 'lion's mane' around the neck"]	9	https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Pomeranian-On-White-01.jpg	["https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Pomeranian-On-White-03.jpg"]	2025-04-09 23:34:36.177001	2025-04-10 08:36:28.117

Despite their intimidating stature, they're often referred to as 'gentle giants' due to their typically friendly and patient demeanor. Their combination of elegance and power makes them one of the most recognizable dog breeds.	Despite the name, Great Danes are not Danish but German in origin. They were developed from mastiff-type dogs and were originally bred to hunt wild boar and protect estates. The breed's name in German is 'Deutsche Dogge' (German Mastiff). The English name 'Great Dane' likely came from French naturalist Comte de Buffon who saw the dogs in Denmark and called them 'Grand Danois'.	[]	Due to their size, Great Danes mature slower than other breeds, reaching full maturity around 2-3 years. They have shorter lifespans than smaller breeds, typically 7-10 years. They're particularly prone to bloat (gastric dilatation-volvulus), a life-threatening condition. Their size requires appropriate space and early training to manage their strength, though they typically have lower exercise needs than many smaller breeds.	["The tallest dog ever recorded was a Great Dane named Zeus, who measured 44 inches at the shoulder", "Scooby-Doo, the famous cartoon character, is a Great Dane", "They were once called 'Boar Hounds' due to their original hunting purpose"]	16	https://res.cloudinary.com/djxv1usyv/image/upload/v1744886094/IMG_7303_oorntl.jpg	[]	2025-04-09 23:34:36.277525	2025-04-17 10:34:56.318

Known for their charming, playful personality combined with a laid-back attitude, they make excellent companions for city dwellers and families alike.	French Bulldogs originated in England as miniature Bulldogs, which were popular with lace workers in Nottingham. When these workers emigrated to France during the Industrial Revolution, they took their small bulldogs with them. The breed became popular in French society and gained their distinctive bat ears through selective breeding. American fanciers in the late 19th century established the bat ear as the correct form, in contrast to the 'rose' ear preferred by the English.	[]	As a brachycephalic (flat-faced) breed, French Bulldogs often suffer from breathing difficulties, which makes them sensitive to heat and exercise. They generally cannot swim due to their heavy heads and compact bodies. Most French Bulldogs must be bred through artificial insemination and delivered by cesarean section due to their narrow hips and the puppies' large heads.	["They snore due to their flat faces", "They can't fly in cargo on most airlines due to breathing risks", "The Titanic had a French Bulldog on board named Gamin de Pycombe"]	4	/uploads/provider-images/1744747444623-609988150.jpeg	[]	2025-04-09 23:34:36.22835	2025-04-15 20:04:05.121

Bred as sled dogs, they are athletic, powerful, and possess remarkable endurance. Their friendly and gentle temperament makes them poor guard dogs but excellent companions.	The Siberian Husky was developed by the Chukchi people of northeastern Siberia as an endurance sled dog for transportation in harsh arctic conditions. They were brought to Alaska in 1909 for sled-dog racing and gained fame during the 1925 serum run to Nome, where they transported diphtheria medicine across Alaska, most notably the lead dog Balto.	[]	Huskies have strong prey drive and may chase small animals. They are notorious escape artists who can dig under or jump over fences. They 'blow' their undercoat twice a year, resulting in massive shedding. Their high exercise needs make them unsuitable for apartments, and their independent nature can make training challenging.	["Huskies can run over 100 miles in a day", "Their howling can be heard up to 10 miles away", "They have a unique relationship with the Chukchi people, who believed them to be spirit guardians"]	15	https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Siberian-Husky-standing-outdoors-in-the-winter.jpg	["https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Siberian-Husky-On-White-01.jpg", "https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Siberian-Husky-On-White-03.jpg"]	2025-04-09 23:34:36.202405	2025-04-10 08:36:41.097

Originally bred as a protection dog, modern Dobermans combine alert watchfulness with loyalty and affection for their families, making them both excellent guardians and devoted companions.	The breed was developed in the 1890s by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann, a tax collector in Germany who wanted a medium-sized, protective companion during his rounds. He mixed various breeds, likely including the Rottweiler, German Pinscher, and Manchester Terrier. The breed quickly gained popularity as police and military dogs due to their intelligence, trainability, and protective nature.	["American Doberman - typically more slender and elegant", "European Doberman - typically more muscular and substantial"]	Traditionally, Dobermans had their ears cropped and tails docked, though this practice is now banned in many countries except for working dogs. These procedures are purely cosmetic, as natural Dobermans have long tails and floppy ears. The breed needs early socialization and consistent, positive training to manage their protective instincts. They bond deeply with their families and can suffer from separation anxiety if left alone too much.

Widely used as working dogs in roles such as police work, military service, search and rescue, and as service dogs, they also make excellent family companions when properly trained and socialized.	The breed was developed in Germany in the late 19th century by Captain Max von Stephanitz, who wanted to create the perfect working dog. The first officially recognized German Shepherd was registered in 1899. Initially bred for herding sheep, their intelligence and versatility quickly led to their use in various working roles, particularly after World War I, when they gained international recognition.	["German working lines - emphasis on working ability, more angular appearance", "West German show lines - emphasis on conformation, more sloped back", "American show lines - most exaggerated slope to the back", "East German (DDR) lines - typically darker, heavier bone structure"]	German Shepherds require early socialization and consistent training to manage their protective instincts. They shed heavily twice a year ('blowing their coat') and need regular grooming. Mental stimulation is as important as physical exercise for this intelligent breed.

Bred to be companions, they are affectionate, outgoing dogs that thrive on human attention and make excellent family pets.	The Shih Tzu (which means 'lion dog') is one of the oldest breeds, originating in Tibet and later developing in China. They were prized by Chinese royalty and were so valued that for years, China refused to sell, trade, or give away any of the dogs. The breed was developed by crossing the Lhasa Apso with Pekingese. The first Shih Tzus arrived in Europe in the 1930s and were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1969.	["Imperial or Teacup Shih Tzu - smaller than standard but not officially recognized"]	The Shih Tzu's long, luxurious coat requires daily brushing and regular grooming to prevent matting. Their flat faces (brachycephalic) make them sensitive to heat and prone to breathing issues. Many owners choose to keep the coat trimmed short in a 'puppy cut' for easier maintenance. Eye problems are common due to their large, protruding eyes, and they may need special attention to keep the area clean.

Known for their even temperament and playful personality, Pugs are affectionate companions who thrive on human interaction. They're famous for their expressive faces and comical antics.	One of the oldest dog breeds, Pugs originated in China around 400 B.C. where they lived in luxury with emperors. Later they were brought to Europe where they became favorites of royalty, including Queen Victoria who bred them herself.	[]	Due to their flat faces, Pugs are prone to breathing difficulties and can overheat easily. They do best in moderate climates with air conditioning in hot weather. Their facial wrinkles need regular cleaning to prevent infections.

Despite its muscular build and imposing appearance, it was specifically bred to be a companion dog with a gentle disposition.	Developed in the 1990s, the American Bully was created by crossing American Pit Bull Terriers with other bulldog breeds. The goal was to create a family companion with the loyalty of bull breeds but with a more docile temperament.	["Standard", "Pocket", "XL", "Classic"]	American Bullies need proper socialization from an early age. They are muscular dogs that require regular exercise to maintain health, but are not as high-energy as some working breeds.	["Despite their strong appearance, they were bred specifically to be family companions", "They're often confused with Pit Bulls but are a distinct breed"]	40	https://res.cloudinary.com/djxv1usyv/image/upload/v1744885539/IMG_8468_impcrx.jpg	[]	2025-04-17 10:14:38.535559	2025-04-17 10:25:39.833

Developed for big-game hunting, they are athletic, courageous, and protective. With proper training, they can be excellent family companions who are devoted to their owners.	Created in Argentina by Dr. Antonio Nores Martinez in the 1920s, the Dogo Argentino was developed by crossing various breeds including the extinct Cordoba Fighting Dog, Great Dane, Bull Terrier, and others. They were designed to hunt large game such as wild boar and puma.	[]	Due to their hunting heritage, they have a strong prey drive and may not be suitable for homes with small pets. They require early socialization, consistent training, and an experienced owner who understands the breed's needs.	["Despite being bred for hunting, they're known for being gentle with their human families", "Their all-white coat helped hunters distinguish them from the prey during nighttime hunts"]	85	https://res.cloudinary.com/djxv1usyv/image/upload/v1744885774/IMG_8473_bqtsdk.jpg	[]	2025-04-17 10:14:38.799292	2025-04-17 10:29:35.358

Originally bred for herding reindeer, pulling sleds, and keeping their owners warm at night, they combine working ability with a gentle, friendly disposition. Their thick double coat, designed for arctic temperatures, requires regular maintenance.	The Samoyed takes its name from the Samoyedic peoples of Siberia, who bred these dogs for herding reindeer, pulling sleds, and keeping children warm at night. They lived closely with their people, explaining their strong people-oriented nature. Western explorers of the Arctic first introduced the breed to England and the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.	[]	Samoyeds blow their thick undercoat once or twice a year, resulting in significant shedding. They do not do well in hot climates and need special attention during summer months. Despite their gentle nature, they have strong working instincts and need regular exercise and mental stimulation to prevent destructive behaviors like digging and barking.	["Their famous 'Sammy smile' prevents drooling and icicle formation in arctic conditions", "Their fur can be spun like wool and was used by Siberian natives for textiles", "The Samoyed was used on many polar expeditions, including Roald Amundsen's successful journey to the South Pole"]	59	https://res.cloudinary.com/djxv1usyv/image/upload/v1744886366/IMG_8483_ionfe8.jpg	["https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Samoyed-On-White-03.jpg"]	2025-04-10 10:34:14.42902	2025-04-17 10:39:30.149

With its clean-cut, balanced build, noble carriage, and hard-muscled body, the Pointer embodies both beauty and athletic prowess. They make loyal family companions but need significant exercise to thrive.	The Pointer's origins trace back to 17th century Europe, developed as field dogs to locate game birds for hunters. English hunters selectively bred them for their pointing ability, stamina, and bird sense. The modern breed took shape in England in the early 1800s, integrating Foxhound, Greyhound, and Bloodhound ancestry. They were brought to America around the Civil War and quickly became prized hunting companions.	[]	Pointers require substantial daily exercise to satisfy their high energy levels. A fenced yard is necessary as they have a strong prey drive and may chase after birds or small animals. While their short coat is low-maintenance, they're not well-suited to cold weather and may need a doggy jacket in winter. They thrive with owners who lead active lifestyles.	["The Pointer's stance was so admired it was used for early British car hood ornaments", "They can maintain their iconic pointing stance for extended periods without moving", "Their incredible sense of smell allows them to detect birds from great distances"]	113	https://res.cloudinary.com/djxv1usyv/image/upload/v1744885811/IMG_8474_me2dzm.jpg	[]	2025-04-10 10:34:14.724721	2025-04-17 10:30:12.285

Larger and more powerful than the Siberian Husky, Malamutes have thick double coats, erect ears, and a plume-like tail. They have a dignified, affectionate personality but can be stubborn and independent.	Named after the Mahlemut Inuit tribe of Alaska, Alaskan Malamutes were bred for pulling heavy sleds over long distances and for hunting large game like polar bears. Valued for their strength and endurance rather than speed, they played a vital role in the Alaskan Gold Rush and in Arctic expeditions. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1935.	["Standard Alaskan Malamute", "Giant Alaskan Malamutes (larger, not officially recognized)"]	Malamutes have a high prey drive and may not be suitable for homes with small pets. They can be dog-aggressive, especially with dogs of the same sex. As working dogs bred for cold climates, they need substantial exercise and can struggle in hot weather. Their strong-willed nature requires consistent, patient training and they're notorious for 'talking' rather than barking.	["They howl rather than bark, creating a distinctive 'woo woo' sound", "Their thick fur enables them to sleep comfortably in temperatures as low as -70°F", "They feature significantly in Inuit mythology, often depicted as creator figures or ancestors"]	58	https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Alaskan-Malamute-On-White-03.jpg	[]	2025-04-10 10:34:14.47903	2025-04-10 10:49:25.575

They have a dense double coat that can be either rough or smooth, a ruff of fur around the head resembling a mane, and a characteristic scowling expression. Reserved and dignified, they form strong bonds with family but can be aloof with strangers.	One of the oldest dog breeds, the Chow Chow originated in China at least 2,000 years ago, possibly descended from Mongolian dogs or Arctic spitz breeds. They were used for hunting, herding, pulling, and protection. In China, they were known as 'Songshi Quan' (puffy-lion dog). They arrived in England and America in the late 19th century and were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1903.	["Rough-coated Chow Chow (more common)", "Smooth-coated Chow Chow (shorter outer coat)"]	Chow Chows require early socialization to manage their reserved, sometimes suspicious nature toward strangers. They are prone to heat sensitivity due to their thick coats and need special attention in warm weather. Their characteristic scowling expression comes from entropion, an inward rolling of the eyelids that can cause eye problems and may require surgical correction.	["They are one of the few breeds with a blue-black tongue", "Their name may come from the Cantonese word 'chow,' meaning 'edible' (they were sadly sometimes used as food in ancient China)", "They have unusually straight back legs, giving them a distinctive stiff gait"]	75	https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Chow-Chow-On-White-01.jpg	[]	2025-04-10 10:34:14.528939	2025-04-10 14:58:12.071

Their unique build allowed them to pursue prey into burrows underground. With their big-dog bark and spirited personality in a small package, they make entertaining companions who form strong bonds with their owners.	Developed in Germany over 600 years ago, Dachshunds were bred specifically to hunt badgers and other burrowing animals. Their long, narrow bodies allowed them to enter tunnels, while their strong paws helped them dig. There were also larger varieties used for hunting wild boar and foxes. They gained popularity outside of Germany in the 19th century and were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885.	["Standard Dachshund (16-32 pounds)", "Miniature Dachshund (under 11 pounds)", "Kaninchen (Rabbit) Dachshund (8-10 pounds, not officially recognized in the US)", "Smooth-coated", "Long-haired", "Wire-haired"]	Due to their long backs, Dachshunds are prone to intervertebral disc disease and should be prevented from jumping from heights or climbing stairs excessively. They can be stubborn and challenging to housebreak. Despite their small size, they need regular exercise to prevent obesity, which puts additional strain on their backs.

Energetic and athletic, they were traditionally used as carriage dogs and firehouse mascots. They make lively and loyal family companions but require significant exercise and training.	The Dalmatian's origins trace back to Croatia's Dalmatia region, though the breed's early history is somewhat unclear. They gained prominence in England during the 1800s as carriage dogs, running alongside horse-drawn carriages. Their affinity for horses and natural guarding instincts made them ideal firehouse dogs in the early days of firefighting, establishing their iconic association with fire departments.	["Standard Dalmatian", "Long-coated Dalmatians (rare, not recognized)"]	Dalmatians are born completely white, with spots developing in the first weeks of life. Around 30% of Dalmatians are born deaf in one or both ears, requiring hearing tests for puppies. Their high energy levels make them unsuitable for sedentary owners, and they need extensive socialization to manage their sometimes reserved or sensitive temperament.

Naturally protective of their families, they are intelligent workers who excel in roles requiring strength, agility, and endurance. When properly trained and socialized, they are calm, confident guardians and loving family companions.	Rottweilers descend from Roman drover dogs, which were used to herd cattle during the Roman Empire's expansion. The breed was developed in Rottweil, Germany, where they were used to drive cattle to market and guard the butchers' money on the return journey, earning them the nickname 'Butcher's Dog.' Later, they were used as police dogs, search and rescue dogs, and guide dogs.	[]	Rottweilers require early, extensive socialization and consistent training to manage their strong guarding instincts. They mature slowly, remaining puppy-like for several years, and their exercise needs change as they grow. Their natural protectiveness means they should be properly introduced to new people, and they may require supervision around unfamiliar children or dogs.

Known for their intelligence, loyalty and strength, they are extremely people-oriented dogs who form strong bonds with their owners and excel in many canine sports including agility, obedience, and weight pulling.	The breed's ancestors originated in the British Isles and were used for bull-baiting until that practice was outlawed. Immigrants brought these dogs to America where they became all-purpose farm dogs, used for hunting, property protection, and as family companions. Despite misconceptions, they were historically known as 'nanny dogs' because of their gentle nature with children.	["American Pit Bull Terrier", "American Staffordshire Terrier (similar but recognized as a separate breed)"]	Due to their history and powerful physique, Pit Bulls require early socialization and training. They can have high prey drive and may not be suitable for homes with smaller pets.

They are known for their adaptability to the Indian climate and living conditions. Intelligent and loyal, they make excellent family pets and are one of the most popular native dog breeds in India.	The Indian Spitz was developed in India, likely from German Spitz dogs brought to the country during British colonial times. They were specifically bred to adapt to the tropical Indian climate while maintaining the appealing spitz characteristics. They gained immense popularity in the 1980s and 1990s when import restrictions made it difficult to acquire foreign breeds in India.	["Greater Indian Spitz (larger variety, 16-18 inches)", "Lesser Indian Spitz (smaller variety, 13-15 inches)"]	The Indian Spitz is known for its ability to adapt to apartment living despite its energetic nature.

Their beautiful coat requires regular grooming to maintain its signature appearance.	Descended from the English Cocker Spaniel, the American Cocker Spaniel was developed in the United States to hunt smaller game birds like woodcock. The breed diverged into its distinctly American type in the early 20th century, with a more domed head, shorter muzzle, and more profuse coat. They were the most popular breed in America for many years and were recognized as a separate breed from their English cousins in 1946.	["American Cocker Spaniel (smaller, with more profuse coat and domed head)", "English Cocker Spaniel (larger, with less coat and flatter skull)"]	American Cocker Spaniels require significant grooming, with professional grooming recommended every 4-6 weeks and regular home brushing. Their pendulous ears need regular cleaning to prevent infections. While generally good with children and other pets, some lines can be prone to temperament issues like shyness or anxiety, so proper breeding and early socialization are important.

Known for their thick coat, lion-like mane, and independent nature, they were traditionally used to protect property, livestock, and monasteries in their native Tibet. They are deeply loyal to their families but wary of strangers, making them excellent guard dogs but requiring responsible ownership.	One of the world's oldest breeds, the Tibetan Mastiff has guarded monasteries and nomadic tribes in the Himalayan region for thousands of years. They were bred to work independently, making decisions without human direction while guarding in harsh mountain conditions. Long isolated in the remote Himalayan plateau, they remained relatively unchanged until the 20th century when they began appearing in the West.	[]	Tibetan Mastiffs are not suitable for novice owners due to their independent, sometimes stubborn nature. They 'blow' their coat once a year in a massive seasonal shed. Generally quiet during the day, they become alert and vocal at night, reflecting their historical role as nighttime guardians. They mature slowly, not reaching full adulthood until 3-4 years of age.	["A Tibetan Mastiff named 'Big Splash' sold for nearly $2 million in China, making it the world's most expensive dog", "They were so prized in ancient China that they traveled with the Emperor's household", "Their thick double coat can withstand temperatures as low as -40°F"]	131	https://res.cloudinary.com/djxv1usyv/image/upload/v1744886346/IMG_8484_filowg.jpg	[]	2025-04-10 10:34:14.580371	2025-04-17 10:39:08.981

Despite their diminutive size, they maintain the proud carriage and intelligence of their larger relatives. Highly trainable and athletic, they excel in canine sports and as therapy dogs. Their hypoallergenic coat makes them suitable for many allergy sufferers.	While Poodles originated as water retrievers (the Standard Poodle), smaller varieties were developed in France for companionship. The Toy Poodle was specifically bred as a city-dwelling companion and lap dog for the French nobility. Their intelligence made them favorites in circuses and performing troupes, and their elegant appearance contributed to their popularity among the European elite.	["Standard Poodle (over 15 inches tall)", "Miniature Poodle (10-15 inches tall)", "Toy Poodle (under 10 inches tall)"]	Toy Poodles require professional grooming every 4-6 weeks or daily brushing if kept in a longer coat. They are long-lived but can be prone to dental issues due to their small jaws. Despite their size, they need proper training and should be treated as dogs, not ornaments, to prevent 'small dog syndrome' behavior problems.

Descended from various bull and mastiff-type breeds, these dogs are confident and alert, making them excellent guard dogs while also being affectionate with their families.	Developed in Pakistan by crossing local bulldog types with imported bull breeds, the Pakistani Bully was traditionally used for guarding, hunting, and as a status symbol. They have gained popularity both in their homeland and internationally in recent decades.	[]	Requires proper socialization from a young age. These dogs are powerful and need an experienced owner who can provide consistent training. They may not do well with other animals unless properly socialized.

Their compact size, pleasant personality, and low maintenance coat have made them popular family pets and hunting companions for centuries.	Beagles have existed since at least the Roman era, but the modern breed developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds including the Talbot Hound and Southern Hound. They were originally bred for hunting small game, particularly hare, by following their scent. The name 'Beagle' may come from the French 'begueule' (open throat) or the Old English 'beag' (small).	["Pocket Beagle - a smaller version standing under 13 inches"]	Beagles are scent hounds with a strong prey drive, meaning they can be easily distracted by interesting smells. They require secure fencing as they may follow scents and wander off. Their howling vocalization (known as baying) can be loud and persistent. They can be stubborn during training and may require creative, reward-based methods.

These dogs are intelligent, loyal, and highly protective of their families. While imposing and alert, they are also affectionate and gentle with family members.	Dating back to ancient Roman times, the Cane Corso descends from Roman war dogs. The breed's name derives from 'cane' (dog) and 'corso' (guardian or protector). They were used as guardians, hunting dogs, and farm workers in rural Italy.	[]	Cane Corsos need early socialization and training from an experienced owner. They are powerful dogs that require consistent guidance. Proper exercise is essential to channel their energy appropriately.	["Their name pronounced 'KAH-nay KOR-so' means 'guardian dog' in Italian", "They nearly went extinct after World War II before dedicated breeders revived the breed"]	32	https://res.cloudinary.com/djxv1usyv/image/upload/v1744885614/IMG_8470_mi3dpn.png	[]	2025-04-17 10:14:38.751669	2025-04-17 10:26:55.402

Despite their elegant appearance, they were bred as alert watchdogs for Tibetan monasteries. They are confident, independent dogs with a dignified manner.	One of the most ancient dog breeds, the Lhasa Apso served as sentinel dogs in Buddhist monasteries in the Himalayan Mountains of Tibet for over 2,000 years. They were considered sacred in their homeland.	[]	The luxurious coat requires regular, extensive grooming unless kept in a shorter 'puppy cut.' Despite their size, they have a strong watchdog instinct and can be reserved with strangers.	["In Tibet, Lhasa Apsos were never sold but only given as gifts", "Their name means 'bearded lion dog' in reference to their appearance"]	71	https://res.cloudinary.com/djxv1usyv/image/upload/v1744886213/IMG_8480_sgd6us.jpg	[]	2025-04-17 10:14:38.607552	2025-04-17 10:36:55.219

Despite their tiny size, they have big personalities—confident, spirited, and often forming strong bonds with a single person. Alert and watchful, they make good watchdogs but may be reserved or defensive around strangers and other dogs.	Named after the Mexican state of Chihuahua, where early examples of the breed were found, their origins remain somewhat mysterious. They may be descendants of the Techichi, a companion dog favored by the Toltec civilization. Archaeological findings suggest similar dogs existed in Mexico as far back as 100 AD. They were first registered with the American Kennel Club in 1904 and gained popularity when famous people like Xavier Cugat carried them in the 1940s and 50s.	["Smooth coat (short-haired)", "Long coat", "Apple head (rounded skull)", "Deer head (longer muzzle, flatter skull)"]	Chihuahuas have a soft spot on their skulls (molera) at birth, which usually closes as they mature. They're sensitive to cold and may need sweaters in cool weather. Despite their small size, they need proper training and socialization to prevent 'small dog syndrome.' They can be difficult to housebreak and are not generally recommended for families with very small children due to their fragility.

Despite their tiny size, they have a bold, confident personality and are known for their vivacious character.	Descended from large Arctic sled dogs, Pomeranians were once much larger. Queen Victoria of England fell in love with the breed while in Italy and began breeding them to be smaller. Their popularity as companion dogs grew tremendously from there.	[]	Despite their small size, Pomeranians have a big personality and need proper training to prevent small dog syndrome. Their thick coat requires regular brushing to prevent matting and manage shedding.	["Two Pomeranians survived the sinking of the Titanic", "The breed's size was reduced by more than 50% in just a few decades"]	23	https://res.cloudinary.com/djxv1usyv/image/upload/v1744885981/IMG_8478_u7wvqv.jpg	[]	2025-04-17 10:14:38.655429	2025-04-17 10:33:02.135

These dogs are powerful, muscular, and have a kind expression. Despite their imposing size, they are extremely gentle and patient, especially with children.	Saint Bernards originated at the Great St. Bernard Hospice, a refuge for travelers crossing the dangerous Alpine pass between Italy and Switzerland. The monks bred these dogs specifically for mountain rescue, where they saved numerous lives in harsh winter conditions.	["Rough coat", "Smooth coat"]	Due to their large size, Saint Bernards require spacious living areas and are not suited for small apartments. They are sensitive to heat and should be kept in cool environments during summer months.

This isn’t only impractical, but I can’t count how many times I’ve found poop bags and leftover treat crumbs in random coat pockets at the most inconvenient times. It wasn’t until I found Puppington’s 3-in-1 Crossbody pouch that I realized I was long overdue for a practical dog-walking bag.</p>\n<p>Since the bag has arrived, it’s been a game-changer. It’s made walks so much more enjoyable, and I don’t have to worry about treats spilling out of my pockets. If there’s one thing I prioritize when buying a bag, it’s organization. I love having a lot of pockets, and Puppington’s pouch is designed to maximize storage. I can fit everything I need (with extra room) without the bag feeling heavy or overstuffed. I’m even able to fit a small toy in it for when I take Micah to the park, which is a huge plus.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite features is the easy-clean treat pocket. As someone who typically stores treats in a Ziplock bag, it’s been great having a pocket made specifically for treats. Cleaning the pocket is a breeze, and giving Micah a snack on the go has never been easier. I also love that every pocket is secured with a zipper. Nothing is worse than spilling your dog’s treats (or your own belongings) all over the ground, and that’s not even a possibility with this bag when it’s zippered shut.</p>\n<p>The built-in poop bag dispenser has been pretty great as well. Nothing beats the convenience of having a poop bag within reach the moment you need it and the fact that the dispenser is built-in means I’m less likely to forget them at home. It&#8217;s awesome that the treat pouch comes with color-matching poop bags, especially since the little dog faces on them are so cute.</p>\n<p>Along with being extremely practical for all things dog-related, it’s also stylish. It can be hard to find a dog-walking bag that doesn’t look tactical, so I was super impressed when I saw this one. It comes in 12 colors and looks like a traditional crossbody bag that you’d wear for everyday activities. I love how classy it looks, and I’m really happy with the blush pink color I got. It can also be styled in three different ways, which is super convenient for different outings. I typically wear it across my body, but the strap is easy to adjust if you prefer a different style.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the durable material, I was even able to use the bag in the rain. The outer lining is water-resistant, which is ideal for rainy days, and it’s easy to wipe down if it gets dirty. After getting dirt on the bag, I used water and a paper towel to clean it, and the spot that I thought would become a stain came right off.</p>\n<h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>\n<div class="su-row"><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#006600;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#009906;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Water-resistant</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Easy to clean</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Adjustable strap</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Durable</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Trainer-approved</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Stylish</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Great organization</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#8c0000;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#bf000a;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Cons</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Pricey</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\n<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764694" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-adjustable-strap.jpg" alt="Puppington 3-in-1 Crossbody Dog Treat Pouch Review - adjustable strap" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-adjustable-strap.jpg 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-adjustable-strap-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-adjustable-strap-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-adjustable-strap-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-adjustable-strap-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-adjustable-strap-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://puppington.co/collections/favorite-things-2024-3-in-1-crossbody-dog-treat-pouch-sets/products/puppington-3-in-1-crossbody-dog-treat-pouch?variant=44200367325403" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on Puppington</span></a></div>\n<h3>3-in-1 Design</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, the bag has a 3-in-1 design that lets you style it three different ways–over your shoulder, across your body, or around your waist–depending on how you like wearing it. It comes with an adjustable strap that’s 23 inches long at its shortest length and 42 inches long at its longest length, so you can easily change up the style to maximize comfort and convenience.</p>\n<h3>Spacious and Functional</h3>\n<p>The bag has two primary pockets–a small one in the front for treats and a larger one in the back to hold your walking essentials–and five pockets total. The treat pocket is uniquely designed for food, which means you can put Fido’s snacks directly in the pouch without worrying about making a mess or contaminating your pup’s snacks. This also means the pocket is really easy to clean. All you need to do is wipe it down with a damp cloth, and it’ll be as good as new.</p>\n<p>The larger pocket is a great place to store your personal items (phone, wallet, sunglasses, etc.) and your dog’s extra gear (leash, wipes, toy, etc.). There are three additional pockets inside as well and a built-in poop bag dispenser. The inner pockets are great for organization, and the poop bag dispenser provides easy access to poop bags so you can easily grab one whenever you need.</p>\n<h3>Matching Poop Bags</h3>\n<p>Each treat pouch comes with color-matching poop bags that fit perfectly in the pouch’s built-in poop bag dispenser. The <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-to-pick-up-dog-poop" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">poop bags are biodegradable</a> and check all the boxes for being certified home compostable (TUV certification, OK Compost Home, and ASTM D6400 compliant). One of the best things about the bags is their extra-thick material and durable design.

Along with having a sleek look and 12 colors to choose from, it’s designed with smart storage pockets to hold everything you need. The dedicated treat pocket is perfect for your furry friend’s treats, and the adjustable strap ensures you stay comfortable no matter how you like wearing it.</p>\n<p>While you can find cheaper options, I do believe the quality of this product matches the price point.</p>\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n<p>When the bag arrived, I brought out all <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-to-protect-your-dogs-while-out-walking" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">my dog-walking essentials</a> (treats, poop bags, leash, dog toy, etc.). I checked out the pockets and started putting items in the bag based on where they naturally fit. Since the poop bags and treats had designated spots, I put those in first. Once everything was in the pouch, I put it on and adjusted the strap. Since I like wearing bags across my body, I adjusted the strap so the pouch fit comfortably as a cross-body bag. After everything was all set, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/national-walk-your-dog-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">I took Micah for a walk</a>!</p>\n<p>The bag worked great when I was out with Micah. The poop bags were easy to grab and the treat pocket was convenient to have. The pouch was lightweight and comfortable too, which was impressive given how many items it could hold!</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764696" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-bag-filled.jpg" alt="Puppington 3-in-1 Crossbody Dog Treat Pouch Review - bag filled" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-bag-filled.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-bag-filled-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-bag-filled-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-bag-filled-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-bag-filled-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Puppington-3-in-1-Crossbody-Dog-Treat-Pouch-Review-bag-filled-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://puppington.co/collections/favorite-things-2024-3-in-1-crossbody-dog-treat-pouch-sets/products/puppington-3-in-1-crossbody-dog-treat-pouch?variant=44200367325403" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on Puppington</span></a></div>\n<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\n<h3>What items can I keep in the bag?</h3>\n<p>The bag is designed for you to keep walking essentials like a phone, wallet, leash, poop bags, sunglasses, treats, wipes, keys, and more.

Every Wednesday, we share a story from one of our Dogsters. This week is about Amanda and her sweet Chihuahua, Subi.</strong></p>\n<p>Subi is not the most typical Chihuahua; she is bold in her barks but meek in her demeanor. Despite being a bit of an introvert, she knows when it’s go-time, and she’s more than ready to unveil the inner bulldog that lives deep down in every Chihuahua. Subi can be pretty noisy sometimes, but is most likely to cower when challenged. Although she may appear like a sweet, timid creature who longs for a gentle pat, she knows how to defend what’s hers when the situation calls for it.</p>\n<p>We recently contacted a plumber to repair our garbage disposal, fully expecting a routine repair. An in-and-out that many service people have accomplished unscathed, countless times before. This time, however, I did not realize that I was about to unleash a beast on an unsuspecting serviceman.</p>\n<p>As soon as the plumber hit our driveway, Subi&#8217;s ears perked. She might have been lounging on the couch seconds before, but the transformation began when that doorbell rang. Like a Power Ranger called for duty – it was morphing time.</p>\n<h2>The Staredown</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764578 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-staring-down_Amanda-800x600.jpg" alt="Subi staring down" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-staring-down_Amanda-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-staring-down_Amanda-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-staring-down_Amanda-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-staring-down_Amanda-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-staring-down_Amanda-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-staring-down_Amanda.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>The first interaction between the two was tense — a big man dressed in all red, toting a giant tool bag. I imagine Subi first laughing at his goofy getup and then chalking him up as a threat after zeroing in on his extra gear. I apologized to our guest as Subi barked relentlessly. He brushed her off as a cutie and bragged about the doggies he had at home. Completely unaware. What’s she going to do? Bark some more?</p>\n<p>This was standard behavior for Subi, though. The <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/why-is-my-dog-excessively-barking" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">excessive barking</a> usually subsides after she gets in a few sniffs. Most new people immediately bend down and show they’re not attempting a hostile takeover, which often goes as you would suspect, but not today. I picked her up and ensured she stayed gated into my office area while this man inspected our plumbing so he could work in peace. Before starting the work, he handed me an iPad to review and approve the projects, and I put Subi on the floor, thinking he had finally passed the vibe check. Spoiler alert, he hadn&#8217;t.</p>\n<h2>Intruder Alert</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764580 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-walking-in-the-living-room_Amanda-800x571.jpg" alt="Subi walking in the living room" width="800" height="571" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-walking-in-the-living-room_Amanda-800x571.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-walking-in-the-living-room_Amanda-600x429.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-walking-in-the-living-room_Amanda-768x548.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-walking-in-the-living-room_Amanda-250x179.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-walking-in-the-living-room_Amanda.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>As one does during a repair, the man frequented his truck for different parts and tools, which meant a lot of opening and closing the front door. After one retrieval, the plumber removed his boots, and Subi lunged. She <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/how-to-stop-a-herding-dog-from-nipping" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">nipped the skin of his middle toe</a>, pinching it like a vice. This gentleman squealed. It was mortifying. This was not something she had ever done before, and luckily, having only a few teeth left, she caused no physical damage. Maybe a slight heart palpitation, but no skin wounds. We awkwardly laughed about it as I locked Subi in my bedroom for the remainder of his visit. I apologized profusely, and he was more than kind and understanding.</p>\n<p>I am not one to leave Yelp or Google reviews, but when this man asked me to do so, I was like, say less. It was the least I could do to make up for the unwarranted dog attack he endured in my home. We wrapped up the bill, said our goodbyes, and off he went.</p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764579 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-looking-outdoor_Amanda-800x600.jpg" alt="Subi looking outdoor" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-looking-outdoor_Amanda-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-looking-outdoor_Amanda-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-looking-outdoor_Amanda-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-looking-outdoor_Amanda-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-looking-outdoor_Amanda-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-looking-outdoor_Amanda.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>All jokes aside, it is so important to <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/why-is-my-dog-afraid-of-strangers" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">separate our pets from strangers</a>, especially in these types of situations where we’re able to control the outcome.

However, we appreciate that you like the article and would love it if you continued sharing just the first paragraph of an article, then linking out to the rest of the piece on Dogster.com.</p>\n<p>In November 2023, young couple Josh and Georgia were enjoying a camping trip on the picturesque Kangaroo Island, just off the coast of South Australia. Along for the trip was their adorable miniature Dachshund named Valerie. Their relaxing holiday took a tragic turn when Valerie managed to escape her pen while her owners were at the nearby beach, and despite the valiant efforts of fellow campers, she disappeared into the wilderness. A devastated Josh and Georgia stayed on the island searching for their beloved pup as long as they could, but they eventually had to admit defeat, returning home to mourn the loss of Valerie, now presumed deceased.</p>\n<p>However, there have been numerous sightings of the wayward wiener dog by locals and visitors, and thanks to the wildlife cameras from <a href="http://www.kangalawildliferescue.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Kangala Wildlife Rescue</a>, a local not-for-profit animal charity, we now have footage, less than 2 weeks old, showing a remarkably healthy-looking Valerie.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764519" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764519" style="width: 803px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-764519" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Its-blurry-but-its-her-Valerie_Barking-News.jpg" alt="It's blurry, but it's her!

Despite the lack of predators on the island, few could have predicted that this tiny dog of less than 9 lbs would have been able to survive in the wild; but survive she has, for more than 16 months. There has been speculation over how she has been able to maintain what appears to be quite a healthy weight, with some suggesting that locals and tourists may have been leaving food down for the lost pup, while others believe she may have been relying on her primitive instincts for hunting and foraging. This might seem laughable when considering the pampered little sausage dogs we know today, but it wasn’t all that long ago that the <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/what-were-dachshunds-bred-for" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Dachshund was an able hunting dog</a>, sent down tunnels in pursuit of badgers.</p>\n<p>Of course, a dog of Valerie’s size would be no match for a badger, not that there are any to be found on Kangaroo Island, of course. She may well be <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/why-are-dachshunds-so-long" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">using her instincts to flush out some small mammals</a>, as well as taking advantage of any roadkill that invariably occurs in an area shared by humans and wildlife. Whatever the case, she has obviously been eating <em>something</em>!</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764520" style="width: 653px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-764520" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valerie-at-home._Barking-News.jpg" alt="Valerie at home" width="653" height="606" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valerie-at-home._Barking-News.jpg.webp 1300w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valerie-at-home._Barking-News-600x557.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valerie-at-home._Barking-News-800x742.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valerie-at-home._Barking-News-768x712.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Valerie-at-home._Barking-News-250x232.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764520" class="wp-caption-text">Valerie at home</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Although proof of Valerie’s survival has elated her owners, as well as the community of fans who have been following her story, her continued evasion of rescuers is proving frustrating. A dedicated group of volunteers has been <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-to-find-a-lost-dog" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">working tirelessly to coax, herd, or trap</a> the delinquent Dachshund without success. She has even ignored the calls of her owners when they returned to the island. However, the community remains optimistic that Valerie’s wild adventures will soon be coming to an end, and we are all desperate to see her back in the arms of her loving owners.</p>\n<p>A fund has been set up by Kangala to help pay for the efforts to rescue Valerie, and donations can be made<a href="https://kangalawildliferescue.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"> via their website</a>.

My Dog has Degenerative Myelopathy</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Dear Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dallas was diagnosed with Degenerative myelopathy almost a year ago. He is really starting to struggle with his back legs, and he is falling a lot. What can I do to help him?” </strong>&#8211; Barbara</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Barbara,</p>\n<p>Thank you for reaching out and for caring so deeply for Dallas. <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/canine-degenerative-myelopathy" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Degenerative myelopathy (DM)</a> is such a heartbreaking condition to witness, as it slowly chips away at a dog’s mobility while they remain mentally bright and engaged. It&#8217;s incredibly difficult watching a beloved friend trapped in a body that’s no longer cooperating. The good news is that there are ways you can support Dallas’s quality of life and help him remain comfortable and active for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>At this stage, when weakness and falls become more frequent, assistive devices can make a significant difference. A well-fitted <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/best-dog-lift-harnesses" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">rear support harness</a> allows you to help Dallas walk with more stability especially when going outside for toileting or navigating slippery floors. Some dogs also benefit from using a wheelchair or cart, which helps take the weight off their hind end and allows them to continue exploring their world with a bit of independence. You can give some of <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/diy-dog-wheelchairs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">these DIY wheelchair projects</a> a try.</p>\n<p>Inside the house, yoga mats or rubber runners can create safe paths that minimize slipping. Physical therapy or hydrotherapy can help maintain muscle tone, support circulation, and slow down further decline, almost like physiotherapy for humans with spinal issues.</p>\n<p>Although there&#8217;s no cure for DM, the goal now is to preserve comfort and dignity. You might also consider working with a veterinarian who offers integrative care, including <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/acupuncture-for-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">acupuncture</a> or <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/what-does-laser-treatment-do-for-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">laser therapy</a>, as some dogs find these therapies helpful in maintaining strength and comfort. If you’re ever uncertain about how to best support Dallas day to day, a <a href="http://www.pangovet.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tele-triage consultation</a> can help guide decisions without requiring a trip to the clinic, especially if mobility is limited.

My Dogs&#8217; Food Has Been Recalled!</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span style="font-size: 17.6px;">&#8220;</span>Hi Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I’ve been buying Carna4 dog food for a while for my dogs Emmy and Tazie from a Seller in PA and recently off Amazon. No one notified us that the products were recalled. That is not right, we have been feeding our dogs this dog food along with their home-cooked meal.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What are the health dangers we now need to be aware of? Whose responsibility is it to notify buyers when dangers exist in any “healthy” foods made for humans and our dear fur babies? Should I throw out our latest bag of Duck, Liver, Eggs, and Sprouted Seeds? We live in a buyer beware world; I didn’t see this coming! &#8220;</strong> &#8211; Donna</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Donna,</p>\n<p>I completely understand your frustration and concern when we choose a commercially available dog food, we expect transparency and safety, especially when it comes to our dogs’ well-being. Emmy and Tazie are lucky to have someone so proactive and tuned into their care.</p>\n<p>To my knowledge, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/carna4-dog-food-review" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Carna4</a> has never had a recall, and none have been reported by the FDA. That said, if you heard this from a reliable source, it’s important to determine exactly why the product was pulled. Some recalls are precautionary, such as minor quality concerns, while others are based on confirmed risks due to potential contamination (like <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/can-dogs-get-salmonella" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Salmonella</a> or <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/what-does-mold-on-dog-food-look-like" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">mold</a>) and with confirmed cases. The latter ones require immediate action, like pulling them off the shelves.</p>\n<p>In general, recalls are issued through coordination with the FDA, and manufacturers are expected to notify retailers, distributors, and, ideally, the public. Unfortunately, not all online retailers or third-party sellers are diligent in passing that information along, which can leave pet parents in the dark. When a recall is announced, particularly if there&#8217;s any risk of illness, it’s safest to stop feeding the affected product immediately and monitor your pets for any unusual signs such as <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/diarrhea-vomiting-in-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">vomiting, diarrhea</a>, lethargy, or appetite changes. Even if Emmy and Tazie seem fine, it&#8217;s a good idea to notify your veterinarian and keep the packaging or batch number handy in case follow-up testing is needed.</p>\n<p>As for responsibility, both the manufacturer and the seller share the ethical obligation to notify consumers, but the reality is, especially in an online marketplace, that follow-through is often inconsistent. In cases like this, it’s always safest to err on the side of caution and discontinue the food until you’ve verified that the batch is not included in the recall. I encourage you to report any concerns directly to the FDA&#8217;s pet food complaint portal—they do take consumer reports seriously, and your voice helps advocate not just for your dogs but for others too. By the way, did you know that <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/how-to-get-dog-food-recall-alerts" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Dogster sends official recall alerts</a> to your email? You can sign up, and you will get an email whenever a dog’s food has a recall issued. I hope this helps!</p>\n<p>Dr. Paola</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716646" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 2 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h3>Help! My Dog Obsessively Licks His Paws!</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Hi Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>My dog Morty obsessively licks his paws and me, especially my hands, arms, legs, and feet. He seems upset when I tell him to stop. Is this anxiety? Should I make him stop or just let him do it? &#8220;</strong> &#8211; Heather</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Heather,<br />\nThank you for sharing this about Morty. It sounds like he’s a very affectionate soul, but I understand how the constant licking can raise questions and even become overwhelming at times. When dogs repeatedly <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/why-do-dogs-lick-their-paws" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">lick their paws</a> or <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-behavior/why-do-dogs-lick-your-feet" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">their humans</a>, it’s often more than just grooming or affection, it can be a sign of an underlying emotional or physical need.</p>\n<p>Licking can serve as a self-soothing behavior, similar to how some people bite their nails when anxious. If Morty seems distressed when you interrupt him, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/anxiety-in-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">anxiety</a> could certainly be playing a role. Separation-related stress, boredom, or even a history of reinforcement (where the licking may have once been rewarded with attention can all contribute. However, it&#8217;s also important to rule out physical causes. Paw licking, in particular, may stem from allergies, irritation, or discomfort. Dogs with environmental <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/allergies-in-dogs-causes-symptoms-treatment" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">allergies</a> often show signs through their skin and paws, and in some cases, it becomes a cycle: itch leads to licking, which leads to more irritation. If his paws look red, swollen, or stained from saliva, it’s worth having your veterinarian examine him.</p>\n<p>Rather than scolding him, which can create confusion or add to stress, try redirecting his energy in ways that meet his emotional and physical needs; for example, give him a <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/best-food-puzzle-toys-for-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">puzzle toy</a>, a frozen <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/benefits-of-lick-mats-for-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">lick mat</a>, or engage him in calm training sessions that use positive reinforcement. You’re right to pause and wonder whether to allow the behavior or not, and the best path forward is usually one of compassionate redirection. If anxiety is suspected but not extreme, a consultation through a <a href="http://www.pangovet.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tele-triage service</a> can help guide you on simple, supportive interventions before moving on to a full behavioral consult. You&#8217;re already doing right by Morty by observing and asking the right questions; sometimes our dogs communicate in licks what they can&#8217;t say in words. Good luck!</p>\n<p>Dr. Paola</p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#004288;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#2575bb;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article is a part of our weekly Ask Dr. Paola series</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong>View past week&#8217;s questions here: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola/monday-march-31-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">March 31, 2025</a></strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola#Past_Articles" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">See our full list of past articles here</a></strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Click here</a> to submit a question</strong> </div></div></div></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola/monday-april-7-2025">Ask Dr. Paola: Monday April 7, 2025</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-paola-cuevas">Dr. Paola Cuevas MVZ (Vet)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

Luckily, they are pretty good when it comes to respecting each other’s privacy while eating, and there is an established hierarchy based on their love for food. There is also a different approach based on whether they are being fed inside or outside.</p>\n<h2>Lava Is Always Special</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764374 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg" alt="Lava eating outdoor" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>Lava has a strange personality. Don’t get me wrong, she loves food, but usually and mostly when that food is on my plate. She’d kill for a bite of table scraps, despite me never giving her anything. As soon as I’m making something or getting ready to eat, there she is, somewhere close by, but not too close, so I wouldn’t realize she is there. As if I could miss a 77-lb dog next to my feet.</p>\n<p>When it comes to her food, Lava often needs persuading to eat. She’s been a picky eater since she was a puppy. This has somewhat improved since she gained two sisters she never asked for, who are now always impatient to clean up her food bowl after she’s done eating. Lava is also a slow eater, and requires her own privacy when she eats. Despite no one really trying to steal her food, there will be a low growl even if there is just a cat a few feet away cleaning themselves, ignoring Lava’s dinner. That’s why, when inside, Lava eats in the downstairs toilet, as the living room and kitchen are one room. This gives her privacy, and no one can disturb her. And when eating outside, I need to supervise the other two so they don’t annoy Lava, who finishes last, cherishing every bite, as if to spite the other two who finished their food more quickly.</p>\n<h2>Hela Is a Foodie</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764375 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg" alt="Hela eating outdoor" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-eating-outdoor_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>Hela, due to her <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/how-i-rescued-a-greek-stray-dog-helas-story" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">history of near-starvation in Greece</a>, is a big foodie. This can be her dry food, wet canned food, treats, or human food, and she will also resort to eating insects and small rodents she finds and catches outside. It’s interesting to see that even after almost 2 years of having a consistent routine when it comes to mealtimes, she still tries to find things to eat outside. There have been many times when I had to try and remove something stinky and rotten from her mouth, which she’s not so tolerant of.</p>\n<p>And Hela is like clockwork. If I sleep in or come home late, she will be the one to clearly show me it’s well past breakfast or dinner time, by sitting right next to me, wagging her tail intensely, and having this persistent stare. She may even walk over to where the food is or casually inspect the cats’ food bowls. Hela eats first when they&#8217;re being fed inside and last when outside. This only means her food bowl reaches her around 20 seconds later than the first dog, but to her, it must seem like an eternity. She is a fast eater, and at times, I <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/are-slow-feeders-good-for-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">use a slow feeder to slow her down a bit</a>. After she finishes, she will clean the other dogs’ bowls until they are spotless.</p>\n<h2>Lajka Is Not a Morning “Person”</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764376 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-waiting-to-be-fed_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg" alt="Lajka waiting to be fed" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-waiting-to-be-fed_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-waiting-to-be-fed_Dr-Maja-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-waiting-to-be-fed_Dr-Maja-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-waiting-to-be-fed_Dr-Maja-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-waiting-to-be-fed_Dr-Maja-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-waiting-to-be-fed_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>And the newest addition, well, as you could have guessed, also loves food. Not knowing her history, it’s difficult to even guess the way she lived, but based on her similarly gross habits to Hela’s of eating all sorts, it’s clear she hadn’t been fed too regularly. She loves everything I give her and will never leave anything behind, unlike Lava, but in the morning, she will not be <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/how-to-stop-a-dog-from-begging-for-food" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">super insistent on asking for food</a>. She will eat her breakfast, but slowly. When fed inside, she eats in her crate and will rush inside, knowing food is coming. Outside, she is the first to get fed, as she follows me around so intently that it only makes sense that she eats first.</p>\n<p>She also respects Hela and Lava and will only approach both when they’re done eating, in the hope that something got missed in or around the food bowl. It’s nice to see how the mealtimes are quite calm and seem to flow, and to outside observers, it must appear like a well-rehearsed play.

Cleaning problem areas and trimming hair growth will keep your dog looking and smelling fresh and tidy. You can also cut or file your dog’s claws down as needed to keep on top of that job, and you should clean your dog’s teeth at least three times a week to help prevent dental disease and decay.</p>\n<p>To help make the process smoother and ensure a positive experience for you and your dog, we have included 12 tips to help with the DIY dog grooming process.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-716650" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 4 oct 2024" width="1360" height="164" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" /></p>\n<h2>The 12 Expert Tips for DIY Dog Grooming</h2>\n<h3>1. Stay Calm</h3>\n<figure id="attachment_502684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-502684" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-502684" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/female-hands-cleaning-dogs-paw-with-wipes_220-Selfmade-studio_Shutterstock.jpeg" alt="female hands cleaning dog's paw with wipes" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/female-hands-cleaning-dogs-paw-with-wipes_220-Selfmade-studio_Shutterstock.jpeg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/female-hands-cleaning-dogs-paw-with-wipes_220-Selfmade-studio_Shutterstock-600x400.jpeg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/female-hands-cleaning-dogs-paw-with-wipes_220-Selfmade-studio_Shutterstock-768x513.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/female-hands-cleaning-dogs-paw-with-wipes_220-Selfmade-studio_Shutterstock-250x167.jpeg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-502684" class="wp-caption-text">Image By: 220 Selfmade studio, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you are feeling anxious, your dog will feel it too. And if they do pick up on your anxiety, they will wonder what is wrong and start to feel anxious about the whole experience. Grooming does not have to be difficult and you can start by desensitizing your pup to the tools and accessories you will be using during the process.</p>\n<p>Get the scissors or trimmers out but don’t cut your dog’s claws. Get them used to being rubbed with a towel. Getting your dog used to even these small elements of the grooming process means there will be fewer steps when you need to do it for real.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>2. Utilize Treats</h3>\n<p>Use treats as rewards for calm behavior and cooperation. If your dog gets in the bath or shower, give them a treat. When they sit to be washed, give them a treat. When they stand so you can wash their belly, give them a treat. It also helps if you and your dog have mastered basic training commands like sit, stand, and lie down.</p>\n<p>Continue with the positive reinforcement training techniques throughout the grooming session.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>3. Get Everything Ready Before You Start</h3>\n<figure id="attachment_691112" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-691112" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-691112" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dog-care-accessories-on-white-background_VeronikaYa_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Dog care accessories on white background" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dog-care-accessories-on-white-background_VeronikaYa_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dog-care-accessories-on-white-background_VeronikaYa_Shutterstock-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dog-care-accessories-on-white-background_VeronikaYa_Shutterstock-800x534.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dog-care-accessories-on-white-background_VeronikaYa_Shutterstock-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dog-care-accessories-on-white-background_VeronikaYa_Shutterstock-250x167.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-691112" class="wp-caption-text">Image By: VeronikaYa, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Have all the supplies you&#8217;re going to need ready before you turn the water on. Get the shampoo and conditioner you will be using and place it next to the bath. Get the towel ready on the rail, and have nail clippers, toothbrush, and toothpaste to hand.</p>\n<p>You don’t want to have to disappear to find the conditioner, leaving your dog standing in the bath and hoping they don’t jump out and run away.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>4. Brush First</h3>\n<p>Before you start washing your dog, brush them to get rid of mats and knots. When matted hair gets wet, it can make the problem much worse.</p>\n<p>Plus, if your dog enjoys being brushed, which some dogs do, it will help relax them and get them in the right frame of mind for a grooming session. Brushing also enables you to identify any problem areas and spots that are going to prove more difficult.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>5. Use Wipes to Hit Problem Areas</h3>\n<p>Wipes are a great way to hit problem areas. Areas that tend to be more difficult include around the eyes where tear stains form, around the feet where your dog may have stood in mud or muck, and on the belly.</p>\n<p>Using wipes before you bathe your dog means you can get rid of some of the stubborn stains without having to try and wash and wipe too hard in the shower. Wipes tend to be more sympathetic than the shower.</p>\n<div class="pnadl-cntn">\r\n<p>\n<div class="aawp">\n\n            \n            \n<div class="aawp-product aawp-product--horizontal"  data-aawp-product-asin="B0C94SDTQY" data-aawp-product-id="103" data-aawp-tracking-id="dogster-email-diy-grooming-20" data-aawp-product-title="Hepper Wash Wipes - Soft Pet Cleaning Wipes Enriched with Aloe & Cucumber Scent for Waterless Grooming - Ideal for Dogs Cats & Other Pets - Safe for Puppies & Kittens">\n\n    \n    <div class="aawp-product__thumb">\n        <a class="aawp-product__image-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C94SDTQY?tag=dogster-email-diy-grooming-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Hepper Wash Wipes - Soft Pet Cleaning Wipes..." rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">\n            <img decoding="async" class="aawp-product__image" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31xxyOEu4+L._SL160_.jpg" alt="Hepper Wash Wipes - Soft Pet Cleaning Wipes..."  />\n        </a>\n\n            </div>\n\n    <div class="aawp-product__content">\n        <a class="aawp-product__title" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C94SDTQY?tag=dogster-email-diy-grooming-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Hepper Wash Wipes - Soft Pet Cleaning Wipes..." rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">\n            Hepper Wash Wipes - Soft Pet Cleaning Wipes...        </a>\n        <div class="aawp-product__description">\n            <ul><li>Gentle Care For All Pets - Infused with moisturizing hypoallergenic ingredients & enriched with...</li><li>Deep Cleans From Head to Tail - Tackle the toughest dirt & messes with our extra strong pet wipes...</li><li>Freshness On The Go - Each dog grooming wipes pack contains 30 counts of premium dog wipes that...</li></ul>        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class="aawp-product__footer">\n\n        <div class="aawp-product__pricing">\n            \n            \n                    </div>\n\n                <a class="aawp-button aawp-button--buy aawp-button aawp-button--amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C94SDTQY?tag=dogster-email-diy-grooming-20&#038;linkCode=ogi&#038;th=1&#038;psc=1" title="Check Price on Amazon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-wpel-link="external">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n            </div>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n</div>\n</p>\r\n<p>Whether your dog needs a quick refresh or cleanup of a sensitive area, pet-safe wet wipes are a convenient option.

Teeth Brushing</h3>\n<p>Brushing your dog’s teeth should be a common ritual. You need to brush your dog’s teeth at least three times a week, and if you do this then you don’t really need to brush teeth when you’re grooming. You can use your grooming session as a timely reminder to keep up with good dental hygiene though.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>7. Nail Trimming</h3>\n<figure id="attachment_538534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-538534" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-538534" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dogster_How-To-Trim-Dog-Nails_Infographic_v1-FINAL_Apr-2-2023.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="720" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dogster_How-To-Trim-Dog-Nails_Infographic_v1-FINAL_Apr-2-2023.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dogster_How-To-Trim-Dog-Nails_Infographic_v1-FINAL_Apr-2-2023-600x360.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dogster_How-To-Trim-Dog-Nails_Infographic_v1-FINAL_Apr-2-2023-768x461.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dogster_How-To-Trim-Dog-Nails_Infographic_v1-FINAL_Apr-2-2023-250x150.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-538534" class="wp-caption-text">You are free to use this image but we do require you to link back to <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/diy-dog-grooming" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Dogster.com</a> for credit</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Similarly, claws should also be trimmed regularly, although they won’t need daily or even weekly trimming. You should regularly inspect your dog’s nails and cut them as needed. You may need to do this more or less often depending on whether your dog runs on abrasive surfaces often, and even just how quickly the claws grow.</p>\n<p>If your dog goes to a professional groomer, you can have them trim the claws, too, but it is a good idea to keep on top of this at home.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re uncertain about trimming your dog&#8217;s nails or are uncomfortable doing so, consult a veterinarian for guidance.

Apply Shampoo Gently</h3>\n<p>It is important to only use a dog-specific shampoo that won’t cause irritation and skin dryness. Once you have applied lukewarm water to your dog’s coat and ensured that they are wet, it is time to apply the shampoo distributing it evenly with your hands.</p>\n<p>Pay special attention to any problem areas you identified during the brushing session. Some of these might still need extra work, even if you use wipes to help ease the problem. Do ensure the shampoo gets into the coat but don’t lather it up too aggressively.</p>\n<div class="pnadl-cntn">\r\n<p>If you are looking for the perfect, pet-friendly shampoo and conditioner combo, we highly recommend the products by Hepper. With a soothing oatmeal shampoo, free of soaps and other harsh chemicals, and a cucumber and aloe scented conditioner, your pet's skin and coat will be smooth, hydrated, and irritation-free. </p>\r\n<p>            <div class="comparison-table">\n                                                                        <table id="wctable-764454" class="wctable">\n\n

You can use a damp cloth to clean around the eyes, but even gentle shampoo will irritate if it gets in your dog’s eyes. If this happens, it will not only make the bath more difficult, but your dog will remember and may start to get anxious the next time it’s bathtime.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>10. Rinse Thoroughly</h3>\n<p>Once you have <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/best-dog-shampoos" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">shampooed the dog’s body</a> and given a little extra attention to the difficult areas, it is time to rinse the shampoo out. Use warm water and aim it away from your dog’s face. Work down the body and use your hands to remove any suds and shampoo from the coat.</p>\n<p>Don’t be too rough but do make sure you have got all of the shampoo out. If you’re using a conditioner, this is usually applied once the shampoo has been removed, but you need to follow the instructions on the bottle because different conditioners have different requirements.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>11. Dry Thoroughly</h3>\n<figure id="attachment_554808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-554808" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-554808" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bichon-frise-dog-wrapped-in-a-towel_Studio-Peace_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="bichon frise dog wrapped in a towel" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bichon-frise-dog-wrapped-in-a-towel_Studio-Peace_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bichon-frise-dog-wrapped-in-a-towel_Studio-Peace_Shutterstock-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bichon-frise-dog-wrapped-in-a-towel_Studio-Peace_Shutterstock-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bichon-frise-dog-wrapped-in-a-towel_Studio-Peace_Shutterstock-250x167.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-554808" class="wp-caption-text">Image By: Studio Peace, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<p>More likely than not, once you stop the water your dog will shake it off and remove the excess. Get the towel ready and have your dog step out into the towel. You want to <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-to-dry-your-dog-after-bath" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">make sure your dog is thoroughly dried</a> once they get out. Leaving the coat wet can irritate and it can make them more susceptible to yeast infections. Damp fur will also make your dog feel cold. If necessary, use a hairdryer in the cold air setting or consider allowing them out in the sun, just not the yard because they might go out straight to roll in the dirt!</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>12. Don’t Overdo It</h3>\n<p>If grooming is an alien experience to your dog, you should start with short sessions. You don’t have to get absolutely everything done in one grooming session.</p>\n<p>If your dog dislikes everything from nail clipping to tooth brushing and washing, doing it all at once will cause more stress, and it&#8217;ll make it more difficult to groom your dog in the future. It will also make the experience more stressful and difficult for you.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that overbathing a dog is not recommended but the frequency of baths depends on each individual’s coat, environment, and activities.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-716650" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 4 oct 2024" width="1360" height="164" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-02-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" /></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Grooming is an important part of canine maintenance.

they may have been for many people. A token symbolizing our strong bonds with our friends. A true honor to make and receive! Although I still love my friends as an adult, these days my dog is definitely my best friend. Mimi Green designed a dog-approved version of the friendship bracelet, so I can gift my furry bestie one of her own! Very similar in style to the beaded ones I remember wearing as a kid, this is such a cute addition to the collar closet that is sure to get my pup a lot of attention.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716647" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-scaled.webp" alt="divider single dog paw oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764428" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-the-product-on-grass.jpg" alt="Custom Beaded Dog Collar Friendship Bracelet Style Review -

Designing the exact friendship bracelet I wanted for my pup Lorelei was very simple &#8211; all of the options on the website are well written out. My dog has an exact 12” neck, so I didn’t need to email about a custom size, but I appreciated that Mimi Green will assist with pups who are in between sizes. I chose the following options:</p>\n<div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> 1 Stand of Beads</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Multi-Color Bead Color</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Purple Star</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> 3/4&#8243; Wide</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Satin Hybrid Buckle</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> The text beads say “Lorelei”</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>The package arrived quickly, and the collar was neatly stowed in a ziploc-style bag. It was so compact that my mailman plopped it in my mailbox rather than by the front door!</p>\n<p>The first thing I wanted to do after taking the collar out of the bag was feel the silicone beads &#8211; I didn’t know what to expect from that and was so curious. The beads were so soft and comfortable, and had a slight squish to them in my fingers. I could tell they have just enough softness and flexibility to be comfortable for my dog, while remaining durable enough for any of her antics. I loved how vibrantly colored all of the beads are (very true to color from the website), and the “Lorelei” text was so easy to read from the text beads!</p>\n<p>The shape of the buckle also impressed me, as the buckle and biothane attachment both have a curve to them. I love how this collar sits on my dog, and the buckle shape plays a significant role in this. The steel D-ring is easy to clasp a leash to, similar to my dog’s other collars.</p>\n<p>Lorelei looks so adorable in this collar, and she didn’t mind it at all. After wearing it for a while, I think my pup forgot it was even on (she even took a nap with it, which isn’t something she does with her other collars), which is a big testament to how comfortable this collar is. My pup is a very polite leash walker, so it was easy to take her on a walk, and I could feel how sturdy the steel chain running inside is.</p>\n<p>Washing was a breeze, I didn’t even need to use soap! Just a quick little rinse.</p>\n<p>Although the website did mention that long-haired dogs may have their fur pinched and tugged in the collar, I haven’t had that experience with Lorelei (and she has quite the lion’s mane around her neck)! I think this is more a matter of making sure you don’t tug on your dog’s collar, especially if you have a longer furred pup. However, this is worth mentioning just in case.</p>\n<p>This addition to Lorelei’s collar closet is a welcome one. Being so unique, I don’t have anything quite like it, and I am helping her stay stylish wherever we go!</p>\n<h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>\n<div class="su-row"><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#006600;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#009906;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Cute designs</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Fully customizable</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Sturdy buckles</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Engraving options</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Easy to clean</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Handmade in the USA</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Open to custom requests</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#8c0000;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#bf000a;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Cons</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> May pinch fur</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764432" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-washing-with-water.jpg" alt="Custom Beaded Dog Collar Friendship Bracelet Style Review -

The silicone is also very comfortable for long-term wear. The buckle is contoured to flow with the round shape of your dog’s neck (rather than being flat). All three buckle options are also known as quick-release buckles, they are easy to pinch open. The buckles are attached to lightweight waterproof biothane tabs.</p>\n<p>The actual “string” that runs through the collar is 1/16 Stainless Steel Cable, which features a 368lbs breaking strength. This being said, I would not recommend using this collar on a dog that tugs a lot &#8211; not because it might break, but because the collar is beaded and may not be suitable for strong pullers.</p>\n<h3>Different Sizes Available</h3>\n<p>There are 17 sizes available for dogs ranging from small (11”) to extra-large (27”). If your pup is between sizes, Mimi Green can make custom sizes as well. Collar width is also customizable, with widths ranging from 5/8” wide, 3/4&#8243; wide, or 1” wide.</p>\n<h3>Fully Customizable</h3>\n<p>Most aspects of the Custom Beaded Dog Collar Friendship Bracelet Style are fully customizable.</p>\n<p>For starters, you can choose between one strand of beads or two. Next, you can personalize the text beads on your collar with either your pet’s name, a phrase, or a phone number (up to 12 characters).</p>\n<p>Your bead color options range from multicolor, white, yellow, pink, purple, teal, and raspberry. You then select from either a heart or a star shape bead, both of which come in either white, yellow, pink, purple, or teal.</p>\n<p>There are three quick-release buckle options: MG2 plastic, Satin Hybrid, or Brass Hybrid. These buckles can be custom engraved for an additional fee. Engraving options include up to three text/number lines and 12 different fonts. A D-ring is included, but additional D-rings can be added.</p>\n<p>Mimi Green also accepts special requests &#8211; you can contact the company prior to ordering and see if your request can be done.</p>\n<h3>Easily Cleaned</h3>\n<p>The Custom Beaded Dog Collar Friendship Bracelet Style is designed to be easy to clean, so your pup can be rambunctious outdoors without worry. Just rinse with water and a gentle soap (if needed) in the sink, and it’ll be good to go. Biothane and silicone don’t tend to stain or hold dirt. As you can imagine, all of the materials are waterproof (hence being able to be washed in the sink).</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>About Mimi Green</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764431" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-dog-wearing-collar-outdoors.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1126" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-dog-wearing-collar-outdoors.jpg 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-dog-wearing-collar-outdoors-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-dog-wearing-collar-outdoors-800x601.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-dog-wearing-collar-outdoors-768x577.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-dog-wearing-collar-outdoors-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-dog-wearing-collar-outdoors-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.shopmimigreen.com/personalized-beaded-friendship-bracelet-dog-collar/" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on Mimi Green</span></a></div>\n<div class="su-table breed-table su-table-alternate">\n<table width="623">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Founded:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">2007</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Story Behind The Name:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Named after a childhood blanket that represents Mimi Green’s values: handmade, functional, holds up over time, and feels good</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Manufacturing:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Hand-made in New Mexico, USA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Warranty:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Malfunctioned collars will be repaired or replaced at no cost.

But in regards to custom dog collars as a whole, the price is definitely a good middle-point!</p>\n<p>You can find other similar-style collars on websites such as Etsy for half the price of Mimi Green. However, those materials are not even close to being as safe and premium as Mimi Green. What you’re paying for are materials that are safe for your pup, comfortable for long-time wear, and will last you a lifetime (the engraving and color won’t fade) &#8211; and that is well worth the price!</p>\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n<p>Testing was simple: Put the collar on the dog! <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-to-walk-a-dog" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">My dog is polite on a leash</a>, so walking her with the Custom Beaded Dog Collar Friendship Bracelet Style was very easy.

Make sure your pup is standing when measuring, because the measurement could be a bit different when your dog sits!</p>\n<p>A big note is <em>not</em> to measure your dog’s existing flat-buckle collars &#8211; because this collar is beaded, the size will not align. Beaded collars are measured by circumference, while flat collars are measured by length.</p>\n<p>If this collar is intended to be used for walking (not just a fashionable accessory), be sure that the size is snug-enough to not slide off when walking on a leash.</p>\n<h3>What If My Dog Is a Leash-Tugger?</h3>\n<p>This collar is not meant for dogs that tend to be rambunctious on walks &#8211; this is a beaded collar, not a flat collar. I feel it would pinch, and the bead shapes would dig in and be<a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/how-to-stop-a-dog-from-pulling-while-walking" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> uncomfortable for dogs that pull</a> on their collars a lot.</p>\n<h3>What If I Want Further Customizations Beyond the Ordering Page?</h3>\n<p>You can feel welcome to contact <a href="https://www.shopmimigreen.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Mimi Green</a> for custom requests! They do their best to accommodate.</p>\n<h3>What If the Collar Doesn’t Fit My Dog?</h3>\n<p>If you ordered the wrong size, reach out to Mimi Green within 7 days and they will send you a one-time code for free shipping and a 50% off coupon to order the correct size! This also applies if you typed in your engraving wrong, or if your dog damaged the collar within the first year.</p>\n<h3>Is It Possible To Use the Collar On a Cat?</h3>\n<p>Size-wise it may be possible, but the collar is really designed for use on a dog. Cats do best with breakaway collars because of how they climb around, and this is not a breakaway!</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764433" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-product-on-harness.jpg" alt="Custom Beaded Dog Collar Friendship Bracelet Style Review - product on harness" width="1500" height="1126" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-product-on-harness.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-product-on-harness-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-product-on-harness-800x601.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-product-on-harness-768x577.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-product-on-harness-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Custom-Beaded-Dog-Collar-Friendship-Bracelet-Style-Review-product-on-harness-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.shopmimigreen.com/personalized-beaded-friendship-bracelet-dog-collar/" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on Mimi Green</span></a></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716649" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog faces oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This is by far the <a href="https://www.shopmimigreen.com/personalized-beaded-friendship-bracelet-dog-collar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">best constructed beaded collar</a> I have ever seen for a dog &#8211; and I scour through a <em>lot </em>of collars for my dog! I loved the softness of the silicone beads and the comfort of using a real buckle (rather than an over-the-head collar that beaded collars tend to be). The nostalgic and adorable design works so well for Lorelei.

I don’t like hearing the excuse of “he doesn’t like me doing it” when people can’t get their dog’s ear drops in.

But out of 5 dogs and 5 cats, having only one that gives us grief over nail clips and other minutiae of maintenance and grooming isn’t too bad.

Last week, we managed to get to the bottom of his <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/chihuahua-abscesses-neds-bummer-of-a-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">anal gland problem</a> using a burrito wrap, and I have previously worked out a method for <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/neds-weepy-peepers-giving-eye-drops-to-dogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">cleaning his eyes and applying eye drops</a>. This week, having been inspired by something I saw during a weekend doomscrolling session, I am going to try the ‘hanging bag method.’</p>\n<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764330 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Getting-the-measure-of-Ned_Dr-Karyn-800x443.jpg" alt="Getting the measure of Ned" width="800" height="443" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Getting-the-measure-of-Ned_Dr-Karyn-800x443.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Getting-the-measure-of-Ned_Dr-Karyn-600x332.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Getting-the-measure-of-Ned_Dr-Karyn-768x425.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Getting-the-measure-of-Ned_Dr-Karyn-250x138.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Getting-the-measure-of-Ned_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>The premise is fairly simple.</p>\n<p>You’ll need a fabric bag – not a plastic one! – that is of a similar size to your dog. Make four holes for the legs that will fit snugly, but not tightly, and one for the head. Ideally, this hole should allow the face to pop out, but not the whole head, though this will depend on the head shape. It’s important that your dog feels secure, not suffocated.</p>\n<p>If you’re going to try this at home, get the bag ready long before you need it, and allow your dog to get used to it, sniff it, even lie on it, providing praise and/or treats when they interact with it. If you go straight to using it for a nail clip, they are going to hightail it out of there when they see it come out next time.</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is going to be more suitable for small dogs, but I have seen some interesting images of large dogs being carried onto subways in very large bags to get around the rules!</p>\n<p>You’re also going to need somewhere to secure the bag, or preferably, someone to hold it for you. Once you have your dog securely held aloft, allow them to relax for a few minutes. Give them a treat and wait for them to calm down before you start gently touching their paws. Don’t go straight in with the nail clippers. At this stage, you should be able to swiftly but carefully trim those talons with no one getting injured or overly stressed.</p>\n<h2>Why Does It Work?</h2>\n<figure id="attachment_764331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764331" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-764331 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Anyone-order-a-Neddy-burrito_Dr-Karyn-800x565.jpg" alt="Anyone order a Neddy burrito?" width="800" height="565" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Anyone-order-a-Neddy-burrito_Dr-Karyn-800x565.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Anyone-order-a-Neddy-burrito_Dr-Karyn-600x424.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Anyone-order-a-Neddy-burrito_Dr-Karyn-768x543.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Anyone-order-a-Neddy-burrito_Dr-Karyn-250x177.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Anyone-order-a-Neddy-burrito_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764331" class="wp-caption-text">Anyone order a Neddy burrito?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Much like the burrito wrap, applying firm, constant pressure over the body stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, bringing about a feeling of calm. It is the same principle used for thundershirts in dogs and compression therapy in autism.</p>\n<p>Because they’re being restrained by you, they aren’t trying to squirm, fight, bite, or scratch their way free, keeping you both safe. Hopefully, if the first few sessions go well, your dog will soon learn that this isn’t the horrific process they always imagined, and may even come to look forward to their hanging mani/pedi with treats.</p>\n<h2>Did It Work?</h2>\n<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so I’m going to let you be the judge.

Here’s what they had to say:</strong></p>\n<h2>Amanda &amp; Subi</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764250" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-getting-a-belly-rub-on-the-couch-pillows_Amanda.jpg" alt="Subi getting a belly rub on the couch pillows" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-getting-a-belly-rub-on-the-couch-pillows_Amanda.jpg.webp 1200w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-getting-a-belly-rub-on-the-couch-pillows_Amanda-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-getting-a-belly-rub-on-the-couch-pillows_Amanda-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-getting-a-belly-rub-on-the-couch-pillows_Amanda-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-getting-a-belly-rub-on-the-couch-pillows_Amanda-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Subi-getting-a-belly-rub-on-the-couch-pillows_Amanda-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>Sleeping is one of Subi’s favorite pastimes. Most of her day is spent in the cozy little dog bed beside mine, away from the noise and action. This might be the most predictable spot for her, but it&#8217;s certainly not the only one as of recently. Lately, I’ve spent more time in our living room, curtains open, basking in the daylight, watching the sun slowly win the battle against the mounds of Canadian snow in our front yard. Surprisingly, Subi has chosen to cuddle next to me, curled up perfectly atop a pillow. I&#8217;m unsure if it is her most cherished spot to sleep, but I enjoy it because it’s nice to see her break out of her lone-wolf rituals. I also like having her close enough to pet a few times throughout the day, which I know she enjoys, too, because she’ll roll onto her back for a few light belly rubs.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716645" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Kate &amp; Gizmo</h2>\n<p>Gizmo’s unquestionable favorite sleeping spot, which I’m also convinced is his soulmate and favorite thing in the world, is our big yellow couch. He is constantly finding inventive new ways to take a snooze on this couch, including on the arms, buried in the back cushions, draped off the ottoman, and even wrapped up in blankets like a baby.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764244" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-sleeping-in-blankets-on-the-yellow-couch_Kate.jpeg" alt="Gizmo sleeping in blankets on the yellow couch" width="801" height="571" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-sleeping-in-blankets-on-the-yellow-couch_Kate.jpeg.webp 1200w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-sleeping-in-blankets-on-the-yellow-couch_Kate-600x428.jpeg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-sleeping-in-blankets-on-the-yellow-couch_Kate-800x570.jpeg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-sleeping-in-blankets-on-the-yellow-couch_Kate-768x547.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-sleeping-in-blankets-on-the-yellow-couch_Kate-250x178.jpeg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></p>\n<p>But as a true Velcro dog, he also requires companionship, so there are nap tier levels: from best to worst, we have on a person, touching a person, near a person, and as an absolute last resort, snuggled up with his doppelganger pillow.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764245" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764245" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-764245" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-cuddled-up-with-his-doppelganger-pillow_Kate.jpeg" alt="Gizmo cuddled up with his doppelganger pillow" width="450" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-cuddled-up-with-his-doppelganger-pillow_Kate.jpeg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-cuddled-up-with-his-doppelganger-pillow_Kate-450x600.jpeg.webp 450w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-cuddled-up-with-his-doppelganger-pillow_Kate-750x1000.jpeg.webp 750w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-cuddled-up-with-his-doppelganger-pillow_Kate-768x1024.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-cuddled-up-with-his-doppelganger-pillow_Kate-250x333.jpeg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-cuddled-up-with-his-doppelganger-pillow_Kate-300x400.jpeg.webp 300w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-cuddled-up-with-his-doppelganger-pillow_Kate-600x800.jpeg.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764245" class="wp-caption-text">In a pinch, a doppelganger will do</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Of course, napping can’t be limited to the living room, so ever-resourceful Gizmo also has comfort-seeking strategies for every other room. The basic premise is that there must be something soft underneath him at all times. Ideally several soft things, like a blanket on top of a pillow, an unexpectedly tiny banana bed (Temu, IYKYK) on top of a rug, or a teetering stack of dog beds. He’s not quite the Princess and the Pea, but he might be her dog…</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764246" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764246" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-764246" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-on-a-pile-of-beds_Kate.jpeg" alt="Gizmo on a pile of beds" width="450" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-on-a-pile-of-beds_Kate.jpeg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-on-a-pile-of-beds_Kate-450x600.jpeg.webp 450w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-on-a-pile-of-beds_Kate-750x1000.jpeg.webp 750w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-on-a-pile-of-beds_Kate-768x1024.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-on-a-pile-of-beds_Kate-250x333.jpeg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-on-a-pile-of-beds_Kate-300x400.jpeg.webp 300w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-on-a-pile-of-beds_Kate-600x800.jpeg.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764246" class="wp-caption-text">Two dog beds are better than one!</figcaption></figure>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Meagan, Draper &amp; Rue</h2>\n<p>Oh my goodness, let me tell you about the adorable snooze-fest that is Draper and Rue! These two fluffy goofballs have turned napping into an Olympic sport, with a whopping 100 different sleeping spots and positions between them. Since they <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/why-do-dogs-sleep-so-much" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">spend about 80% of their day catching Z’s</a> (lucky little rascals!), picking just one favorite for them to brag about is like trying to choose the cutest puppy in a litter—impossible! But don’t worry, I won’t make you jealous by listing all 100 of their cozy hideouts (you’d need a nap just to recover from that!). Instead, I’ll spill the beans on their top 5 faves each.</p>\n<p><strong>Draper:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tucked into my belly, baby spoon style</li>\n<li>At our heads, on top of our pillows</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/do-dogs-need-sunlight-to-be-healthy" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">In a pool of sunshine</a> on the floor</li>\n<li>Curled into a donut in his bed</li>\n<li>On top of a fuzzy blanket</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764248" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Draper-sleepy_Meagan.jpg" alt="Draper sleepy" width="802" height="524" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Draper-sleepy_Meagan.jpg.webp 1400w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Draper-sleepy_Meagan-600x392.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Draper-sleepy_Meagan-800x523.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Draper-sleepy_Meagan-768x502.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Draper-sleepy_Meagan-250x163.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></p>\n<p><strong>Rue:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On your lap</li>\n<li>Under the covers at your feet</li>\n<li>Corner of the bed in the sunshine</li>\n<li>On top of Draper</li>\n<li>On our back deck in the sunshine</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764249" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rue-Sleepy_Meagan.jpg" alt="Rue Sleepy" width="808" height="528" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rue-Sleepy_Meagan.jpg.webp 1400w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rue-Sleepy_Meagan-600x392.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rue-Sleepy_Meagan-800x523.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rue-Sleepy_Meagan-768x502.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rue-Sleepy_Meagan-250x163.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716649" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog faces oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-03-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Nicole, Mac &amp; Rosa</h2>\n<p>Many people know cats as the characters who get bed after bed, bought for them only for them to lie on the box it came in or in the middle of the floor. Well, in our home, when it comes to sleeping positions and locations, our dogs are cats.</p>\n<p>I think it stemmed from our cat, who passed away earlier this year. He was here first, and when Rosa joined the family, she looked to him for everything. He had a tiny cave bed, and she would try to fit inside it (it didn’t work; she’s a big dog, and he was a little cat). We <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/best-donut-dog-beds" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">got him a new donut bed,</a> and Rosa would always try to steal it from him, so we ended up getting her one too. It was so tiny, but she never slept in her medium-sized dog bed, ever. She loves the bean bags, loved my pregnancy pillow, but a regular dog bed? No, thank you.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-764418" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Everybody-loves-the-cats-bed-e1743736311801.jpg" alt="Everybody loves the cat’s bed" width="933" height="582" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Everybody-loves-the-cats-bed-e1743736311801.jpg 2000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Everybody-loves-the-cats-bed-e1743736311801-600x374.jpg 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Everybody-loves-the-cats-bed-e1743736311801-800x499.jpg 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Everybody-loves-the-cats-bed-e1743736311801-768x479.jpg 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Everybody-loves-the-cats-bed-e1743736311801-1536x958.jpg 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Everybody-loves-the-cats-bed-e1743736311801-250x156.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px" /></p>\n<p>Then, when Mac joined the family, he looked to Rosa. We got him a nice big bed, and because she wouldn’t sleep on it, he thought, ‘Well, if it isn’t good enough for Rosa, it isn’t good enough for me. I’ll snuggle in nice and small and try to fit in the cat’s bed too.’ He also loves the outdoor couch, but thankfully, he has never tried to get on the indoor one. He’s too big to share with!</p>\n<p>The dogs are happy lying on the grass, sometimes even on the gravel driveway, so it still boggles my mind that the expensive big woolen bed they have rarely gets used.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764298" style="width: 805px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-764298" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mac-and-Rosa-sunbathing_Nicole.jpeg" alt="Mac and Rosa sunbathing" width="805" height="604" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mac-and-Rosa-sunbathing_Nicole.jpeg.webp 1024w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mac-and-Rosa-sunbathing_Nicole-600x450.jpeg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mac-and-Rosa-sunbathing_Nicole-800x600.jpeg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mac-and-Rosa-sunbathing_Nicole-768x576.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mac-and-Rosa-sunbathing_Nicole-250x188.jpeg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mac-and-Rosa-sunbathing_Nicole-500x375.jpeg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764298" class="wp-caption-text">Mac and Rosa sunbathing</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Rosa also loves to be in corners, whether on the floor or on the couch she’s not allowed on (but does it anyway when we’re not looking). I think it makes her feel protected and cozy. Mac, on the other hand, if he had his way, he’d have his head on the pillow on the bed next to me. Both dogs prefer being on our bed, but Rosa prefers it most when we aren’t on it with her.</p>\n<p>They have their favorite spots, but they’re also pretty laid back when they have to get up and move to a new location, and they are always happy to try something new out, even if it doesn’t stick. At the end of the day, I think they would enjoy having our bed to themselves the most and having us in another room. Maybe a bedroom for our dogs is next on the list?</p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#00285e;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#1E5B91;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article features all of the Dogsters in our Wednesday Dogs of Dogster series.</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#FAA41A"></i> <strong>Read their previous article: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/wednesday-dogs-of-dogster-nicknames" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">The Art of Nicknaming Your Dog: Tales from the Wednesday Dogs of Dogster (with Video)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/favorite-sleeping-spots-the-wednesday-dogs-of-dogster">Favorite Sleeping Spots: The Wednesday Dogs of Dogster Catch Some Zs</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dogedit">Dogster Team</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

Daily Changes</h3>\n<p>Although a small minority of dogs are allergic to something in their food, most allergies are environmental.</p>\n<p>Determine where your dog walks and what they do before having allergic reactions and try to make changes to avoid the allergens that are causing problems. This might mean taking a different route while you’re out walking or preventing your dog from rolling in a certain part of the garden.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_622021" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-622021" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-622021" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Beagle-shaking-outdoors_Przemek-Iciak_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Beagle shaking outdoors" width="1000" height="630" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Beagle-shaking-outdoors_Przemek-Iciak_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Beagle-shaking-outdoors_Przemek-Iciak_Shutterstock-600x378.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Beagle-shaking-outdoors_Przemek-Iciak_Shutterstock-768x484.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Beagle-shaking-outdoors_Przemek-Iciak_Shutterstock-250x158.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-622021" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Przemek Iciak, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<h3>2. Change Their Diet</h3>\n<p>If you’ve taken your dog to the vet and they have told you that your pup is allergic to a particular food ingredient, you should look for an alternative food that avoids those ingredients. There are many foods on the market, including those with unique protein sources that avoid some of the more common food allergens.</p>\n<p>Change their diet slowly to prevent diarrhea and gastrointestinal problems and make sure the food meets all of your dog’s nutritional requirements.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>3. Install an Air Purifier</h3>\n<p>Some environmental allergens might be present in the air in your home. It might be dust mites or pollen that is triggering allergic reactions. An air purifier helps remove allergens from the air to provide fresh air that should prevent allergic reactions in your pup.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_607654" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-607654" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-607654" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/indoor-air-purifier-under-the-desk_Parinya-Smithijaroenpon_Shutterstock.jpeg" alt="indoor air purifier under the desk" width="1000" height="674" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/indoor-air-purifier-under-the-desk_Parinya-Smithijaroenpon_Shutterstock.jpeg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/indoor-air-purifier-under-the-desk_Parinya-Smithijaroenpon_Shutterstock-600x404.jpeg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/indoor-air-purifier-under-the-desk_Parinya-Smithijaroenpon_Shutterstock-768x518.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/indoor-air-purifier-under-the-desk_Parinya-Smithijaroenpon_Shutterstock-250x169.jpeg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-607654" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Parinya Smithijaroenpon, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<h3>4. Oatmeal Bath</h3>\n<p>An oatmeal bath can be great for soothing itchy skin. It acts as an emollient, effectively holding moisture against the skin to reduce dryness and itching. You can create an oatmeal bath yourself for your dog by blending oatmeal into a fine powder and adding it to your dog’s bath water.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can use an oatmeal shampoo when bathing your dog. It will not only help to soothe sore skin, but it can also help to remove any environmental allergens that are lodged in the fur.</p>\n<div class="pnadl-cntn">\r\n<p>If you are looking for the perfect, pet-friendly shampoo and conditioner combo, we highly recommend the products by Hepper. With a soothing oatmeal shampoo, free of soaps and other harsh chemicals, and a cucumber and aloe scented conditioner, your pet's skin and coat will be smooth, hydrated, and irritation-free. </p>\r\n<p>            <div class="comparison-table">\n                                                                        <table id="wctable-764291" class="wctable">\n\n

Yogurt</h3>\n<p>Yogurt can make a great addition to your allergic dog’s diet. The natural probiotics can help balance good vs bad bacteria and keep yeast and bacterial skin infections under control. Most pups love the flavor of this creamy treat and it can make a healthy topper, especially for dry kibble.</p>\n<p>Some dogs are lactose intolerant, though, so start with a small amount and monitor for signs. If you do notice any vomiting or a change in stools, stop feeding yogurt and look for an alternative. You should also only choose plain yogurt, which doesn’t contain sweeteners or extra sugar.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_622970" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-622970" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-622970" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-bowl-of-plain-yogurt_Nishihama_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="a bowl of plain yogurt" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-bowl-of-plain-yogurt_Nishihama_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-bowl-of-plain-yogurt_Nishihama_Shutterstock-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-bowl-of-plain-yogurt_Nishihama_Shutterstock-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-bowl-of-plain-yogurt_Nishihama_Shutterstock-250x167.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-622970" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Nishihama, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<h3>6. Probiotics</h3>\n<p>Probiotics are good bacteria that live in the gut whose main job is fighting off bad bacteria and promoting good digestive health. They can also help regulate the immune system, which means strengthening your dog’s response to allergies.</p>\n<p>If your dog has loose stools or other digestive problems, either as a result of food allergies or any medication they are taking to combat the signs, probiotics can help here, too. Live yogurt is a good source of probiotics, but not all dogs can eat lactose.</p>\n<p>Probiotics can also be found in some dog foods and there are probiotic supplements that can be given.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>7. Coconut Oil</h3>\n<p>Coconut oil is a substance that can be used orally or topically. When applied topically, it helps get rid of itchiness and inflammation. The consistency makes it ideal for <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/can-i-put-coconut-oil-on-my-dogs-nose" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">simply rubbing into the affected area of your pup’s skin</a>.</p>\n<p>As with chamomile, it is safe for consumption in small amounts, so it won’t cause any ill effects if your dog licks the oil after it has been applied.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_622969" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-622969" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-622969" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-vial-of-coconut-oil_New-Africa_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="a vial of coconut oil" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-vial-of-coconut-oil_New-Africa_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-vial-of-coconut-oil_New-Africa_Shutterstock-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-vial-of-coconut-oil_New-Africa_Shutterstock-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/a-vial-of-coconut-oil_New-Africa_Shutterstock-250x167.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-622969" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: New Africa, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<h3>8. Vitamin E Supplement</h3>\n<p>Vitamin E is a strong antioxidant that fights free radicals to prevent damage to tissue and cells. Vitamin E is commonly found in commercial dog foods and may also be included in some shampoos and other dog products.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can buy vitamin supplements that are fortified specifically with vitamin E, and you can buy vitamin E topical creams and oils for application directly on afflicted areas of the body to relieve inflammation.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>9. Fish Oil</h3>\n<p>Omega-3 fatty acids help with a host of functions, from heart health to skin and coat condition. These fatty acids can be added to food to help reduce inflammation in the skin that can help relieve itchiness, swelling, and redness.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_556251" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-556251" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-556251" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Fish-oil-capsules-on-a-wooden-spoon_E.Va_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Fish oil capsules on a wooden spoon" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Fish-oil-capsules-on-a-wooden-spoon_E.Va_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Fish-oil-capsules-on-a-wooden-spoon_E.Va_Shutterstock-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Fish-oil-capsules-on-a-wooden-spoon_E.Va_Shutterstock-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Fish-oil-capsules-on-a-wooden-spoon_E.Va_Shutterstock-250x167.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-556251" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: E.Va, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<h3>10. Aloe Vera</h3>\n<p>Aloe vera is used to treat burns and other skin conditions, and it can be used to help dogs with itchy, flaky skin. It has anti-inflammatory properties, as well as antioxidants, and you can add a few drops to your dog’s water bowl or over their food or apply an aloe vera gel to red and inflamed areas of skin.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>11. Chamomile</h3>\n<p>Chamomile is a great natural treatment for a variety of ailments and problems, including allergies. It can be applied topically to help soothe irritated skin. It offers an immediate cooling effect that brings relief, and it has the added benefit of a pleasant smell.</p>\n<p>Make some chamomile tea, let it cool, and dilute it with a little extra water, before spraying it onto the affected areas of your dog. It’s safe for dogs to drink in small quantities, which makes it a viable solution to the problem.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_622968" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-622968" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-622968" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chamomile-tea-bag_Avocado_studio_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="chamomile tea bag" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chamomile-tea-bag_Avocado_studio_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chamomile-tea-bag_Avocado_studio_Shutterstock-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chamomile-tea-bag_Avocado_studio_Shutterstock-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/chamomile-tea-bag_Avocado_studio_Shutterstock-250x167.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-622968" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Avocado_studio, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<h3>12. Epsom Salts</h3>\n<p>Epsom salt is made up of magnesium and sulfate. It is commonly added to baths to help with swelling, soreness, and relaxation as well as wound healing and soothing skin irritated by allergies.</p>\n<p>Add half a cup to your dog’s bath or soak a cloth in Epsom salt solution and apply it to the affected areas of your dog.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>13. Apple Cider Vinegar</h3>\n<p>Apple cider vinegar is a popular home remedy for a lot of human conditions, including allergies, though there is little scientific evidence that it actually works. It’s also popular with pet owners. It is said to help ward off fleas and it can help control the signs of allergies in dogs.</p>\n<p>Mix apple cider vinegar in a spray bottle with water and apply the solution to itchy, red areas of skin that your dog is scratching. Alternatively, you can add some to your dog’s bath. Apple cider vinegar does have a strong, acidic smell, though, and some dogs really dislike it. It can also be drying to the skin, so be sure to not overdo it and speak to your vet first.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_588384" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-588384" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-588384" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-cup-and-bottle-of-apple-cider-vinegar_ThamKC_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="a cup and bottle of apple cider vinegar" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-cup-and-bottle-of-apple-cider-vinegar_ThamKC_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-cup-and-bottle-of-apple-cider-vinegar_ThamKC_Shutterstock-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-cup-and-bottle-of-apple-cider-vinegar_ThamKC_Shutterstock-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-cup-and-bottle-of-apple-cider-vinegar_ThamKC_Shutterstock-250x167.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-588384" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: ThamKC, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-716645" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws oct 2024" width="1203" height="145" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-01-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1203px) 100vw, 1203px" /></p>\n<h2>What Causes Allergies?</h2>\n<p>An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system overly reacts to a harmless substance and essentially tries to fight that substance. Such substances can include anything from pollen to dust, but they can also include food sources, perfumes, or fleas.</p>\n<p>The most common and obvious symptoms of allergies in dogs are scratching and itching, as well as flaky and red skin. Your dog may also have puffy, red, swollen eyes, and may cough or sneeze more than usual.</p>\n<p>Allergies typically cannot be cured, but it is possible to help control the signs. This usually involves lifestyle and habit changes, as well as the application of topical creams or the administering of medication or other remedies.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_601727" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-601727" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-601727" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dog-scratching-its-body_jubatusdj_Shutterstock.jpeg" alt="dog scratching its body" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dog-scratching-its-body_jubatusdj_Shutterstock.jpeg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dog-scratching-its-body_jubatusdj_Shutterstock-600x400.jpeg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dog-scratching-its-body_jubatusdj_Shutterstock-768x512.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dog-scratching-its-body_jubatusdj_Shutterstock-250x167.jpeg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-601727" class="wp-caption-text">Image By: jubatusdj, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>How Do You Know What Your Dog Is Allergic To?</h2>\n<p>Context and timing can help determine what your dog is allergic to, so if you notice your dog always has an allergic reaction after walking in a particular field, there may be a plant or something else in that field they are allergic to, or they may have a reaction after eating a particular food.</p>\n<p>However, it isn’t always obvious.

Unfortunately, for those of us who love dogs but deal with allergies, the relationship can be hard at times. Yes, dogs need to spend time outside getting exercise and going potty. Unfortunately, this is where the allergens that can make our asthma and allergies go insane reside.</p>\n<p>Our canine companions’ fur can act as a carrier for these airborne allergens, bringing them into the house after walks. Let’s take a look at seven ways you can reduce the amount of allergens your dog brings in. This will make allergy season easier for everyone involved.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-467465" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-03.jpg" alt="Dogster_Website dividers_v1_Jan 18 2024-03" width="1000" height="120" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-03.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-03-600x72.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-03-768x92.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-03-250x30.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>\n<h2>The 7 Ways to Stop Dogs From Bringing Outdoor Allergens Home</h2>\n<h3>1.  Wipe Your Doggy Down</h3>\n<p>When it is time for your dog to come back inside after spending time in the allergen-filled outdoors, take time to wipe them down with a damp cloth before you bring them into the house. There are even<a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/best-dog-wipes" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> doggy wipes on the market</a> you can buy to use for this purpose. While it may not remove every allergen on your dog’s fur, wiping their body and paws is a great way to limit the amount they bring with them.</p>\n<div class="pnadl-cntn">\r\n<p>\n<div class="aawp">\n\n            \n            \n<div class="aawp-product aawp-product--horizontal"  data-aawp-product-asin="B0C94SDTQY" data-aawp-product-id="103" data-aawp-tracking-id="dogster-email-allergens-home-20" data-aawp-product-title="Hepper Wash Wipes - Soft Pet Cleaning Wipes Enriched with Aloe & Cucumber Scent for Waterless Grooming - Ideal for Dogs Cats & Other Pets - Safe for Puppies & Kittens">\n\n    \n    <div class="aawp-product__thumb">\n        <a class="aawp-product__image-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C94SDTQY?tag=dogster-email-allergens-home-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Hepper Wash Wipes - Soft Pet Cleaning Wipes..." rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">\n            <img decoding="async" class="aawp-product__image" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31xxyOEu4+L._SL160_.jpg" alt="Hepper Wash Wipes - Soft Pet Cleaning Wipes..."  />\n        </a>\n\n            </div>\n\n    <div class="aawp-product__content">\n        <a class="aawp-product__title" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C94SDTQY?tag=dogster-email-allergens-home-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" title="Hepper Wash Wipes - Soft Pet Cleaning Wipes..." rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">\n            Hepper Wash Wipes - Soft Pet Cleaning Wipes...        </a>\n        <div class="aawp-product__description">\n            <ul><li>Gentle Care For All Pets - Infused with moisturizing hypoallergenic ingredients & enriched with...</li><li>Deep Cleans From Head to Tail - Tackle the toughest dirt & messes with our extra strong pet wipes...</li><li>Freshness On The Go - Each dog grooming wipes pack contains 30 counts of premium dog wipes that...</li></ul>        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class="aawp-product__footer">\n\n        <div class="aawp-product__pricing">\n            \n            \n                    </div>\n\n                <a class="aawp-button aawp-button--buy aawp-button aawp-button--amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C94SDTQY?tag=dogster-email-allergens-home-20&#038;linkCode=ogi&#038;th=1&#038;psc=1" title="Check Price on Amazon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored" data-wpel-link="external">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n            </div>\n\n</div>\n\n    \n</div>\n</p>\r\n<p>If you're searching for a simple and safe solution to clean your dog, then well-formulated wipes like <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C94SDTQY?tag=dogster-email-allergens-home-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Hepper's Wash Wipes</a></strong> may be the perfect solution.

Brush Your Dog Before They Come Back Inside</h3>\n<p>A good grooming session outside is another smart way to limit the number of allergens your dog brings into the house. If you suffer from allergies yourself, make sure to wear a mask and perhaps gloves before taking on this task, or ask someone who is not allergic to do this. Once you’re ready, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/best-dog-brushes" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">use a clean brush</a> and go over your dog’s coat thoroughly. This will keep most of the allergens stuck to their fur outside instead of on your furniture and floors.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>3. Try to Walk Your Dog in Low Allergen Areas</h3>\n<figure id="attachment_749558" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-749558" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-749558" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/owner-with-whippet-on-a-leash-walking-outdoors-Dora-Zett-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="owner with whippet on a leash walking outdoors" width="1000" height="664" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/owner-with-whippet-on-a-leash-walking-outdoors-Dora-Zett-Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/owner-with-whippet-on-a-leash-walking-outdoors-Dora-Zett-Shutterstock-600x398.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/owner-with-whippet-on-a-leash-walking-outdoors-Dora-Zett-Shutterstock-800x531.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/owner-with-whippet-on-a-leash-walking-outdoors-Dora-Zett-Shutterstock-768x510.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/owner-with-whippet-on-a-leash-walking-outdoors-Dora-Zett-Shutterstock-250x166.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-749558" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Dora Zett, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you know what you are allergic to then try your best to avoid walking your dog in areas where those allergens are in high amounts. For example if you have a grass pollen allergy, avoid walking through grassy fields in pollen season and try to <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/can-dogs-be-allergic-to-grass-vet-answer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">stop your dog from rolling in grass</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>4. Use a Microfiber Doormat</h3>\n<p>Your pooch walks across the doormat each time they go in and out of the house. If you weren’t aware, there are microfiber doormats on the market that are designed to not only catch dirt and water on your dog’s feet as they come inside but also allergens. These types of mats come in handy all through the year, not only when allergens are at their worst.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>5. Give Fido a Bath</h3>\n<figure id="attachment_258191" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-258191" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-258191" src="https://dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/giving-a-bath-to-miniature-schnauzer-dog_SashkaB_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="giving a bath to miniature schnauzer dog" width="800" height="533" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-258191" class="wp-caption-text">Image by: SashkaB, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<p>One surefire way to help remove allergens from your dog when they come inside is to bathe them. Unfortunately, this solution isn’t very convenient. Even if your dog loves bath time, the idea of tossing them into the tub each time they step outside can become tedious and it is not good for their skin. Instead, try doing it once a week to help eliminate allergens on their fur.</p>\n<div class="pnadl-cntn">\r\n<p>If you are looking for the perfect, pet-friendly shampoo and conditioner combo, we highly recommend the products by Hepper.

Wash Their Bedding Regularly</h3>\n<p>Anywhere your dog lies and sleeps will have more allergens from your dog’s fur. Washing them regularly, at least once a week, should help keep the allergen level down in your house.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>7. Wash Your Hands</h3>\n<figure id="attachment_114094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114094" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-114094" src="https://dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/woman-washing-her-hands.jpg" alt="woman washing her hands" width="810" height="570" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114094" class="wp-caption-text">Image by: slavoljubovski, Pixabay</figcaption></figure>\n<p>After your dog has come in from outside and you’ve done everything you can to reduce the number of allergens they are bringing into your home, don’t forget yourself. Wash your hands each time you touch your pooch after a trip outdoors. This will help keep you from being the one to spread allergens around the house and make things worse for your seasonal woes.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-511735" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-01-TEST.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="120" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-01-TEST.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-01-TEST-600x72.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-01-TEST-768x92.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-01-TEST-250x30.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>\n<h2>Other Tips for Fighting Allergies</h2>\n<p>While all these tips are great at helping to reduce the allergens your dog is bringing into the house, it is simply impossible to stop them all. Unfortunately, the world is full of them. Let’s take a look at other tips to help lower allergens in the home when they inevitably get there.</p>\n<h3>Have a Safe Space</h3>\n<p>If you <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/worst-dog-breeds-for-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">suffer from allergies, especially dog allergies</a>, having a safe space away from your pets is good for your health. It also helps keep an area clear of allergens you may miss when trying to clean them off your dog.<a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/is-it-possible-to-build-immunity-to-dog-allergies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> If your allergies are severe</a>, it may be in your best interest to have your bedroom as a pet-free room. This will help you combat any allergens that accidentally sneak in on your pup.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_153822" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153822" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-153822" src="https://dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Welsh-corgi-pembroke-dog-in-an-open-crate-during-a-crate-training-happy-and-relaxed_Jus_Ol_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Welsh corgi pembroke dog in an open crate during a crate training, happy and relaxed" width="800" height="534" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-153822" class="wp-caption-text">Image by: Jus_Ol, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Keep the House Clean</h3>\n<p>Sure, you do routine cleaning of your home, but during allergy season, you may need to do more. Plan on <a href="https://petkeen.com/remove-pet-hair-from-your-carpet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">vacuuming carpets once or twice a day</a> with a cleaner that uses a HEPA filter. This will help grab any allergens you missed on your dog. It will also lower the amount of dust and dander in your home, which should help your allergies significantly. You should also keep all surfaces in the home wiped down and dust-free.</p>\n<h3>Use a Good Air Filter</h3>\n<p>They may be more expensive, but allergy-reducing air filters are the way to go if you’re an allergy sufferer. These filters can capture dust, pollen, pet dander, and a host of other allergens when they make it inside your home. The real key with these filters, however, is to stay on top of changing them. Yes, it is great to spend the extra money, but if they aren’t changed every 3 months, they can’t do their job properly.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-467465" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-03.jpg" alt="Dogster_Website dividers_v1_Jan 18 2024-03" width="1000" height="120" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-03.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-03-600x72.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-03-768x92.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Jan-18-2024-03-250x30.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For those of you out there who suffer from allergies, anything that keeps them at bay can help. While your canine best friend doesn’t carry allergens into your home on purpose, it does happen. If you want to limit the number of allergens your dog brings from outside, give these suggestions a try. Hopefully you will feel better with fewer allergens in the home.</p>\n<div class="su-accordion su-u-trim"> <div class="su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-default su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed" data-scroll-offset="0" data-anchor-in-url="no"><div class="su-spoiler-title" tabindex="0" role="button"><span class="su-spoiler-icon"></span>Sources</div><div class="su-spoiler-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim">\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-stop-your-dog-from-bringing-outdoor-allergens-in-1848880261" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Life Hacker</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://asthma2.com/how-you-can-keep-outdoor-allergens-from-coming-indoors/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Midwest Allergy Sinus and Asthma</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.dailypaws.com/living-with-pets/pet-friendly-home/how-reduce-pet-allergens-home" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Daily Paws</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>  </div>\n<hr />\n<p>Featured Image Credit: Kristesoro, Shutterstock</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/how-to-stop-dogs-from-bringing-outdoor-allergens-home-updated">How to Stop Dogs From Bringing Outdoor Allergens Home: 7 Vet-Approved Ways</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dogedit">Dogster Team</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

Some of the most inspirational tales we’ve seen recently are about a very special group known as The Unstoppable Dogs. Taking on a special needs dog is a huge commitment that few people have the time, dedication, or patience to make. For Debbie Pearl of Huntington Beach, California, it is a commitment she has made over and over again.</p>\n<p>Debbie’s work training dogs for film and television inspired her to start <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dream_fetchers?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&amp;igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Dream Fetchers</a>, a non-profit organization that specialized in animal-assisted therapy for hospitals, schools, and other settings. It was through her work there that she met Eddie, a terrier with spinal trauma resulting in hind limb paralysis. Inspired by his spirit and resilience, Debbie was determined to help other dogs in need of rehabilitation and support, leading her to create <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theunstoppabledogs?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&amp;igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">The Unstoppable Dogs</a>.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764170" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764170" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-764170 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Eddie_theunstoppabledogs-800x450.jpg" alt="Eddie" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Eddie_theunstoppabledogs-800x450.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Eddie_theunstoppabledogs-600x338.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Eddie_theunstoppabledogs-768x432.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Eddie_theunstoppabledogs-250x141.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Eddie_theunstoppabledogs-480x270.jpg.webp 480w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Eddie_theunstoppabledogs.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764170" class="wp-caption-text">Eddie (Image by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theunstoppabledogs?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&amp;igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">@theunstoppabledogs</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>The Unstoppable Dogs</h2>\n<p>As you watch the stories of these dogs unfold, it would take some superhuman stoicism not to feel a tug at the heartstrings.

Well, any space, for that matter. They will try and sit everywhere, including in your lap, despite their less-than-small body weight. And then there’s the couch. You may well say goodbye to enjoying a peaceful night in front of the TV or having friends over, as dogs will literally be everywhere.</p>\n<h2>Three Can Fit, No Problem</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764162 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Hela-playing-on-the-couch-while-Lava-is-sittin-beside-them_Dr-Maja-800x450.jpg" alt="Lajka and Hela playing on the couch while Lava is sitting beside them" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Hela-playing-on-the-couch-while-Lava-is-sittin-beside-them_Dr-Maja-800x450.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Hela-playing-on-the-couch-while-Lava-is-sittin-beside-them_Dr-Maja-600x338.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Hela-playing-on-the-couch-while-Lava-is-sittin-beside-them_Dr-Maja-768x432.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Hela-playing-on-the-couch-while-Lava-is-sittin-beside-them_Dr-Maja-250x141.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Hela-playing-on-the-couch-while-Lava-is-sittin-beside-them_Dr-Maja-480x270.jpg.webp 480w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Hela-playing-on-the-couch-while-Lava-is-sittin-beside-them_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>The surprising fact is, no matter how small a couch or even a single bed is, at least two dogs will fit in there without any problem, leaving absolutely no room for one person. And the third one will also try to join up if given the opportunity. And somehow, the couch will be able to make room for all the four-legged beasts, but no humans whatsoever. And we won’t even get into the dog hair issue. It’s not even an issue; it’s a constant presence, like breathing air. And then, to make it even more interesting, despite a big garden, Hela and Lajka choose to play on the couch, as the most convenient location in the entire home. And when I say play, I mean violently and excitedly biting one another in a playful manner, running around, and jumping up and down on the sofa. I don’t need to even mention how many times a day the vacuum cleaner is out.</p>\n<h2>I Guess It’s What I Signed Up For</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764164 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hela-and-Lajka-playing-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-800x450.jpg" alt="Hela and Lajka playing on the couch" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hela-and-Lajka-playing-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-800x450.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hela-and-Lajka-playing-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-600x338.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hela-and-Lajka-playing-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-768x432.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hela-and-Lajka-playing-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-250x141.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hela-and-Lajka-playing-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-480x270.jpg.webp 480w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hela-and-Lajka-playing-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>It’s funny how rescuing a dog, or two, or three, you don’t think about little things that become a daily meaningful occurrence. You focus on cost, dog food, vet bills, and training, but forget about the joys of sharing funny moments with them on a daily basis. One of those moments, for sure, is sitting on the couch, with three dogs around me, while the smallest one, Lajka, is usually in my lap or next to my shoulder. And for those few silent moments, when no one is playing, jumping, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/dogs-and-barking-getting-lava-hela-lajka-to-stop" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">or barking</a>, and everything is still, I can actually appreciate how much they have given me, without even asking for anything in return. Except for the dog hair, I wish they kept that to themselves.</p>\n<h2>Lava Is a Solo Player</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764161 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lava-sleeping-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg" alt="Lava sleeping on the couch" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lava-sleeping-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lava-sleeping-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lava-sleeping-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lava-sleeping-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lava-sleeping-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lava-sleeping-on-the-couch_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>Lava is my special one, for sure. She is such a grump. She will play on her own terms, when and where she wants it, and how she wants it. Everything else is a no, and she will proudly growl to make sure everyone is aware of her opinion. And there is jealousy. As soon as Hela and Lajka try to get my attention, there is Lava’s butt, pushing them away, and finding a place next to me. Or <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/dogs-and-sleeping-arrangements-whats-mine-is-theirs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">on top of me</a>, if I’m lying down. It’s funny how such a big dog can fit into all sorts of small spaces when she wants to.</p>\n<p>Lava is a proper loner sometimes. She doesn’t like to share the couch, and has the most disappointed look on her face when Hela and Lajka are there. She will try to stay in her spot for a few minutes, so they won’t occupy it, but soon enough, as the other dogs’ excitement becomes too much for her, she will leave and find herself a different resting place.</p>\n<h2>Dog Couch Is the Only Way Forward</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764163 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Hela-and-Lava-sleeping-on-the-couch.-Lajka-sleeping-on-the-separate-couch._Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg" alt="Hela and Lava sleeping on the couch.

At least to trick them into choosing it, as if it were their own decision, and not something imposed. That’s wishful thinking, but I do plan on something similar in the next couple of years as I finish my house. In the meantime, we&#8217;ll all have to settle on having a hairy couch, with awkward paws and heads sticking out from everywhere, and avoiding inviting any non-dog-loving guests for the foreseeable future. Well, as long as there are soft dog paws and wet noses to cuddle, I don’t mind.</p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#00285e;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#1E5B91;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article is a part of Dr. Maja, Lava and Hela's series.</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#FAA41A"></i> <strong>Read her previous article: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/dogs-and-barking-getting-lava-hela-lajka-to-stop" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Dogs and Barking: Getting Lava, Hela &amp; Lajka to Stop</a><br />\n</strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#FAA41A"></i> <strong>Read her next article: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/feeding-frenzy-lava-hela-lajka" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Feeding Frenzy: Lava, Hela &amp; Lajka’s Mealtimes</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/doggy-couch-wars-the-battle-for-comfort">Doggy Couch Wars: The Battle for Comfort</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-maja-platisa">Dr. Maja Platisa DVM MRCVS (Veterinarian)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

My Dog is Chewing On Everything!</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Dear Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>My pup Zoey is a Shih Tzu Bichon mix. She’s chewing stuff up, and I dont know<br />\nwhat is going on with her. I’m concerned about her.<br />\n” </strong>&#8211; Trevor</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hey Trevor,</p>\n<p>It sounds like Zoey is going through a frustrating phase, and I understand why you&#8217;re concerned. Chewing can be a normal behavior for dogs, but when it becomes excessive or destructive, it often signals an underlying need. It could be it&#8217;s teething, boredom, anxiety, or even a lack of appropriate outlets for her natural instincts. Since she’s a <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/shichon" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Shih Tzu-Bichon mix</a>, she likely has a combination of traits from both breeds, including a strong playful tendency, which might make managing her behavior a bit more challenging.</p>\n<p>First, consider her age; if she’s still a <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/when-do-dogs-stop-teething" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">puppy, teething</a> discomfort could be driving her to <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-behavior/why-do-dogs-chew-everything" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">chew on anything</a> she can find. If she&#8217;s older, she may be experiencing boredom or stress. <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/how-to-stop-a-dog-from-chewing" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Providing appropriate chew toys</a>, puzzle feeders, and regular exercise can help redirect her energy in a positive way. If she’s left alone for long periods, she might be chewing as a way to cope with <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/anxiety-in-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">anxiety</a>. In that case, interactive toys or even scent games can keep her engaged. If her chewing seems compulsive or is accompanied by other concerning behaviors, a vet check might be needed to rule out underlying medical issues.

My Bloodhound Gets Reoccurring Ear Infections !</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span style="font-size: 17.6px;">&#8220;</span>Hi Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Beretta is a Bloodhound who gets reoccurring ear infections when we take her to the vet. It’s usually yeast sometimes though it’s an infection as well no matter what we do that just keeps coming back. Any suggestions? Thank you. &#8220;</strong> &#8211; Lacey</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Lacey,</p>\n<p>I completely understand how frustrating and concerning <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/dogs-ear-infection-wont-go-away" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">chronic ear infections</a> can be, especially in a breed like a <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/bloodhound" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Bloodhound</a>. Their long, floppy ears create a warm, moist environment that yeast and bacteria thrive in, making them naturally prone to these recurring issues. Since Beretta keeps experiencing these infections despite treatment, it&#8217;s important to look at the bigger picture and make sure you include both the underlying causes and long-term management strategies.</p>\n<p>Recurrent ear infections are often linked to allergies, whether environmental (like pollen or dust mites) or food-related. If you haven’t already, you might want to explore a <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/what-is-hypoallergenic-dog-food-made-of" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">hypoallergenic diet</a> trial to see if food sensitivities are contributing to the problem. <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/how-to-clean-dog-ears" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Regular ear cleaning</a> is also key, but it’s important to use a veterinary-recommended drying solution rather than overcleaning, which can disrupt the natural balance of the ear canal. Since <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/yeast-infection-in-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">yeast</a> thrives in damp conditions, drying her ears thoroughly after baths, swimming, or even humid weather can make a big difference. If infections continue despite these measures, a deeper diagnostic approach that includes ear cytology, culture, or <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/how-does-allergy-testing-in-dogs-work-vet-answer" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">allergy testing</a> may help pinpoint an underlying issue that needs more targeted treatment. Given how persistent these infections have been, it may also be worth discussing long-term management options with your vet, such as immunotherapy for allergies or a specific maintenance plan to prevent flare-ups.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Dr. Paola</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716646" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 2 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h3>Help! My Dog Vomits After Every Meal!</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Hi Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>My dog Codie is a King Charles Cavalier and Maltese mix. I have had him on Purina food since he was a pup, and started with Purina ONE Smart Blend. I recently bought the Purina True Instinct dog food with real turkey and venison to give him a variety of tastes, but this one makes him vomit every time he eats it. Why could that be? He will be 3 years old in May. Please explain why one formula was fine and this one is not. Thanks!&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Donna</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Donna, it sounds like Codie may have a <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/dog-food-allergies-vs-intolerance" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">sensitivity or intolerance</a> to one of the ingredients in the new food. Even though both Purina ONE SmartBlend and True Instinct products are from the same brand, their formulations differ in protein sources, fat content, additives, and digestibility. Dogs, just like people, can tolerate some foods well while others upset their stomach. Since Codie vomits every time he eats the new blend, it suggests that something in the formulation isn’t agreeing with him.</p>\n<p>There are a few possible reasons for this reaction. One is that he could have an intolerance to venison, which he hasn&#8217;t been exposed to before, or there might be a higher fat content that is too rich for his digestive system. Another possibility is an ingredient like peas, lentils, or certain preservatives that differ from what his system is used to processing. Sudden dietary changes can also trigger gastrointestinal upset, but since he reacts every time he eats it, it’s more likely an issue with the food itself rather than <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/how-to-switch-dog-food" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">just the transition</a>.</p>\n<p>To keep Codie comfortable, I’d recommend stopping this food immediately and returning to what he was eating before. If you still want to offer variety, introduce new proteins gradually, one at a time, to see how he tolerates them. If vomiting persists even after switching back, it would be best to <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/when-should-i-take-my-dog-to-the-vet-for-vomiting" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">have him checked by a veterinarian</a> to rule out any underlying conditions. Keeping track of which proteins or ingredients cause an issue can help guide you toward the best diet for him.</p>\n<p>All the best,</p>\n<p>Dr. Paola</p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#004288;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#2575bb;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article is a part of our weekly Ask Dr. Paola series</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong>View past week&#8217;s questions here: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola/monday-march-24-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">March 24, 2025</a></strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola#Past_Articles" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">See our full list of past articles here</a></strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Click here</a> to submit a question</strong> </div></div></div></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola/monday-march-31-2025">Ask Dr. Paola: Monday March 31, 2025</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-paola-cuevas">Dr. Paola Cuevas MVZ (Vet)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

Not literally, but it has certainly been poked, prodded, and scrutinized more than he felt was appropriate.</p>\n<p>It all started with Ned doing a little bit of bottom-scooting, jumping up as though he’d been stung on the bum, and walking as though he’d soiled his non-existent pants. This led me to inspect his less glamorous side and find an angry, purplish swelling beside his anus – full disclosure, I like to pronounce this word ‘anooss’ because it somehow makes a less appetizing subject sound ever so slightly more cute.</p>\n<p>I knew right away that we were dealing with an anal gland abscess, and that both Ned and I were in for a very unpleasant time. Him, because this is quite a painful problem, and me, because I don’t like seeing Ned in pain, nor do I like how he tends to take that pain out on me.</p>\n<h2>Getting to the Bottom of the Problem</h2>\n<figure id="attachment_764053" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764053" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-764053 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ned-is-not-happy_Dr-Karyn-800x605.jpg" alt="Ned is not happy" width="800" height="605" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ned-is-not-happy_Dr-Karyn-800x605.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ned-is-not-happy_Dr-Karyn-600x454.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ned-is-not-happy_Dr-Karyn-768x580.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ned-is-not-happy_Dr-Karyn-250x189.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ned-is-not-happy_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764053" class="wp-caption-text">Ned is not happy</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Every dog has a pair of scent glands that sit either side of the anus (now you’re saying it too 😉) that are normally expressed when they poop, and sometimes when they are startled or scared. It’s not terribly uncommon for <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/butt-seriously-why-anal-gland-care-matters" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">tiny dogs like Ned to have difficulty emptying these glands</a> for several reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>tiny glands = tiny ducts = lots of resistance.</li>\n<li>anal gland fluid is often quite thick, which brings us back to the first problem.</li>\n<li>more sensitive to slight changes in diet (ie, eating things they shouldn’t), which can result in diarrhea or softer stools, making it even more difficult to empty the glands.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If these glands become overly full or blocked, that pressure will build up, leading to a hot, swollen area under the skin, like a boil, as the impacted gland tries to release pressure elsewhere. In this case, the path of least resistance is through the skin, which is why we get an abscess. Sometimes they are infected, and sometimes it is simply inflamed, as was the case with Ned.</p>\n<p>The most painful part of the anal gland abscess is the moment before it bursts, when the skin over the top is stretched, inflamed, and sore to touch, which is why he acted like he’d been stung by a bee whenever he planted his tushie on the floor. I knew what I had to do to relieve the pain, but I also knew that it would involve about ten seconds of even more pain, followed by blessed relief. Enter the burrito. Not the tortilla wrapped deliciousness of the Chihuahua’s native land, but one with a wriggly Ned filling wrapped in a towel.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764054" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764054" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-764054 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Did-someone-order-a-Neddy-Burrito_Dr-Karyn-800x565.jpg" alt="Did someone order a Neddy Burrito?" width="800" height="565" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Did-someone-order-a-Neddy-Burrito_Dr-Karyn-800x565.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Did-someone-order-a-Neddy-Burrito_Dr-Karyn-600x424.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Did-someone-order-a-Neddy-Burrito_Dr-Karyn-768x543.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Did-someone-order-a-Neddy-Burrito_Dr-Karyn-250x177.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Did-someone-order-a-Neddy-Burrito_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764054" class="wp-caption-text">Did someone order a Neddy Burrito?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>You might recall one of my <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/commandments-for-successful-puppy-parenting-part-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ten Commandments for Successful Puppy Training</a>: “Thou shalt not let puppies make the rules” where I advise dog owners to get their puppies accustomed to having their feet touched, mouth inspected, ears cleaned, and all the things that we will need to do at various stages in their life. This is very much a commandment I always live by, but have failed miserably at in the case of Ned. The trouble with trying to coerce a creature that is about as large and robust as a pigeon into acquiescing to things they don’t want to do is that they are very difficult to restrain. You can’t use any level of forceful restraint without risking breaking them, which allows them to squirm and wriggle away from anything they see as potentially unpleasant. It has meant coming up with different tactics for performing basic procedures like <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/neds-weepy-peepers-giving-eye-drops-to-dogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">cleaning eyes</a>, and as you’ll see next week, trimming claws.</p>\n<p>In order to address Ned’s painful little abscess, I stashed the Chihuahua burrito under one arm and used some cotton wool soaked in hot (not too hot, just slightly above body temperature) salty water to apply pressure to the swelling so it could burst and relieve the pressure that was causing my little buddy so much distress. After ten seconds of squealing and savaging my left hand, Ned found himself feeling relieved and almost completely pain-free, able to once again take on the world, and most importantly, the proffered piece of chicken from my hand.

valuable a harness can be. Along with being a fun (and stylish) walking accessory, a harness keeps your dog safe while giving you more control over your best bud. I’ve tried out several harnesses for my dog over the years, and Joyride has by far been one of my favorites.</p>\n<p><a href="https://joyrideharness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Joyride Harness</a> is a dog company that specializes in making functional and fashionable dog harnesses. They have a variety of styles and colors to choose from and over 30 different designs, including everything from polka dots to glow-in-the-dark snowflakes.</p>\n<p>One of their newest and most popular summer harnesses is their Summer Mesh Harness.

It gave him more room to breathe, and I didn’t feel like I was constantly pulling on his neck. Over the years, I’ve tried different harnesses to see which ones work best for Micah, and I love finding new ones to use for the different adventures we take.</p>\n<p>When I learned about Joyride, I was excited to try them out. I love the look of their harnesses and there are so many fun colors, patterns, and designs to choose from.</p>\n<p>After browsing their selection, I decided on the Summer Mesh Harness. It’s not quite summer yet, but I like harnesses that allow airflow to keep Micah cool. This harness is perfect because it has a mesh design that is lightweight and breathable.</p>\n<p>When the harness arrived, it was packaged in a super cute bag with paw prints and pug faces on it. After opening the package, I put the<a href="https://joyrideharness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"> no-pull harness</a> on Micah to try it out. I had to loosen the straps quite a bit, but the large size fit Micah perfectly once the straps were adjusted (Micah is 54 lbs with a 28” chest). Next, I took Micah for a walk!</p>\n<p>My first impression is that this is a high-quality harness. It’s sturdy and stylish and has all the bells and whistles you need to make it extremely functional. It also does exactly what Joyride says–keeps your dog cool with the mesh material and helps you and your pup have an enjoyable walk with the no-pull technology.</p>\n<p>One thing I love is the EZ grip handle. This is amazing if you need to keep your pup close to you. There are several times on hikes when large groups of people (and dogs) come by, and I like having Micah as close to me as possible. I normally cinch up the leash so he’s by my side, but with the harness, I can grab the handle and have a solid hold on him.</p>\n<p>Joyride also includes 13 nametags, which are fun to play around with, especially if you like personalizing your dog’s walking accessories. It’s also great if your dog is a service animal or a puppy in training and you want to let people know right off the bat.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, I found the harness to be incredibly secure. I feel comfortable and confident taking Micah for a walk, and I have peace of mind knowing he’s safe. While it’s definitely thick compared to other harnesses, if you like having a firm hold on your dog, this is the one to get.</p>\n<p>If there’s one thing I struggled with, it was the Velcro strap. The strap is strong, which is great for keeping your pup secure, but it also means it’s hard to adjust. The good thing is once you adjust it for your dog the first time, you don’t need to mess with it again.</p>\n<h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>\n<div class="su-row"><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#006600;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#009906;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Breathable</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Lightweight</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Adjustable</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Durable</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> No-Pull Technology</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Reflective</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#8c0000;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#bf000a;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Cons</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Velcro is hard to adjust</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764045" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-grip-handle.jpg" alt="Joyride Summer Mesh Harness Review - grip handle" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-grip-handle.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-grip-handle-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-grip-handle-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-grip-handle-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-grip-handle-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-grip-handle-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="http://shrsl.com/4vfwu" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Latest Price</span></a></div>\n<h3>How it Works</h3>\n<p>The first thing you’ll do is pick out a harness style that you love and a size that fits your dog. Once the harness arrives, try it out on your pup! Unbuckle the clasp and slip the harness over your dog’s head so the Velcro strap is on your dog’s chest and the buckle is under their front legs. Adjust the straps until the harness fits snugly without being too tight.</p>\n<p>You can attach your leash to one of three rings on the back and there’s an EZ grip handle to give you better control over your dog and make taking it off a breeze. If you’re out at night, the stitching around your dog’s head and chest is reflective to help them stay visible, and the <a href="https://joyrideharness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">dog harness</a> comes with 13 nametags that you can customize specifically for your furry friend.</p>\n<h3>Breathable and Lightweight</h3>\n<p>The claim to fame for this harness is the dual mesh (2.0) material. This breathable fabric keeps your dog cool on hot days so they can stay comfortable even in the most intense heat. It has three layers–a high-density inner lining that acts as a base, a stretchy interlayer that connects the base and the shell, and a breathable outer layer that maximizes airflow.</p>\n<p>The outer layer is a shell fabric designed with mesh holes to allow air to flow through, and all three layers work together to keep your pup comfortable.</p>\n<h3>No-Pull Technology</h3>\n<p>Joyride designs their harnesses to help you and your dog have an enjoyable and relaxing wal, no matter how strong your dog is. To make this happen, they included three rings for you to attach a leash to–one in the middle and two on each side. This way, if your dog pulls, they’ll end up facing you instead of pulling you.</p>\n<p>The harness is also designed to stop pulling without applying pressure to your dog’s throat like a collar would. This helps keep your four-legged friend safe while giving you greater control of your pup.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>About Joyride Harness</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764046" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-close-up-with-name.jpg" alt="Joyride Summer Mesh Harness Review - close up with name" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-close-up-with-name.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-close-up-with-name-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-close-up-with-name-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-close-up-with-name-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-close-up-with-name-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Joyride-Summer-Mesh-Harness-Review-close-up-with-name-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="http://shrsl.com/4vfwu" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Latest Price</span></a></div>\n<div class="su-table breed-table su-table-alternate">\n<table width="623">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Headquarters:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Based in Los Angeles, CA and their fulfillment center is in Savannah, GA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Sourcing:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">The harness is made in China</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Warranty:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">1-year warranty on the harness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Shipping:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Processing time is 1-2 business days and standard shipping is 2-5 business days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Returns:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">60-day return policy</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Is the Summer Mesh Harness a Good Value?</h2>\n<p>This harness is a great value. Along with being durable and high-quality, it does a great job of keeping your dog secure on walks and cool in warm weather. The EZ grip handle is perfect for when you need to get ahold of your pup and the reflective strap keeps your dog safe when the sun goes down. Overall, I’d say this harness is a solid choice and a great value for the money.</p>\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n<p>I initially put the harness on Micah to see if it fit. Micah is a 54 lb Standard Goldendoodle and measures 28” around his chest. According to his measurements, he’s borderline between a medium and a large. I ended up going with a large based on his weight and it’s a perfect fit! The straps are adjusted almost as large as they’ll go, giving him a little bit of wiggle room without being too tight.</p>\n<p>Once the harness was on Micah, I took him outside for a test run. I walked him around my driveway for a little while before taking him on a walk around my neighborhood.

Joyride includes 13 free interchangeable and customizable nametags with each harness. There are a few pre-made options like, “Emotional Support” and <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/national-hug-your-dog-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">“Free Hugs”</a>, as well as a few blank tags for you to write your pup’s name or create your own.</p>\n<h3>Are there other styles and patterns?</h3>\n<p>Joyride makes a variety of harnesses in different styles and patterns. They have everything from a NightSafe light-up harness to a 2 in 1 jacket harness. They also have a pattern for every season.</p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#004288;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#2575BB;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">A few of their patterns include:</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Flowers</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Plaid</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Snowflakes</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Camo</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Skulls</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Hearts</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Polka dots</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n<h3>What does the warranty include?</h3>\n<p>When Joyride says this is “the last dog harness you’ll ever have to buy”, they mean it. If your harness is defective or breaks within 365 days of delivery, they’ll cover your purchase.</p>\n<h3>How do I measure my pet?</h3>\n<p>Joyride has a size guide on their website that you can reference to find the perfect fit for your pup. The sizing is <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/how-heavy-should-my-dog-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">based on your dog’s weight and girth</a> (the widest part of their rib cage).</p>\n<h3>Is Pug Life Harness part of Joyride Harness?</h3>\n<p>Pug Life Harness and Joyride Harness are the same company.

I adore anything that has my pup Lorelei’s face on it! When Instapainting came across my radar, the idea of getting a custom-painted portrait of her sweet bug-eyed face was really appealing. Acquiring a custom painting has been challenging in the past, as it involves finding an artist <em>and</em> finding something within your price range. Instapainting acts as the middleman to make your artwork dreams come to fruition as efficiently as possible!</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764023" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-close-up-of-painting.jpg" alt="Instapainting Custom Oil Painting Review -

I wouldn’t even know where to begin with that for myself, so Instapainting was something I was eager to try.</p>\n<p>I started by selecting the kind of painting I wanted, and although all mediums produce great work, oil painting is something I wanted to use to capture my pup’s personality. I also really like how smooth and vibrant that medium is, as I planned to provide a very colorful reference image that matches with the decor of my home. Instapainting made the ordering process very simple, providing a few options to choose from.</p>\n<p>The options I selected were:</p>\n<div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> <em>Size &#8211; 16&#8243; x 20&#8243;</em></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> <em>Number of subjects &#8211; 1 Subject</em></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> <em>Artist Location &#8211; Global Artists &amp; Studios</em></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> <em>Finishing Option &#8211; Rolled</em></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> <em>Methodology &#8211; Enhanced Accuracy</em></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> <em>Can we use this as a portfolio piece? &#8211; Yes</em></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> <em>Delivery Deadline &#8211; Standard Delivery (approx 3 weeks)</em></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Once the order was placed, I received an email from Instapainting stating that several artists would offer their painting styles up for me to choose from. Once the artists had populated the Artist and Studio Responses page, I was able to scroll through them all, view their portfolios, and see if they would charge an additional fee to use or not.</p>\n<p>Instapainting automatically highlighted the artist that they felt fit my criteria the best, and that was Peter Lin, whom I ended up selecting! After selecting Peter, the correspondence started. He asked me if I had any requests for him, if I wanted the painting adjusted in size to fit the composition, and more. I found Peter to be very communicative, and the platform was easy to use.</p>\n<p>Although I liked this hands-on approach, my only little critique would be that I had no idea that this would be the process. Based on the website, I didn’t catch the fact that you need to wait for artists to apply, and then you have to spend time selecting them. This did make the painting process longer because I had assumed that Instapainting would automatically match me with someone and the painting would have already been started. Had I missed their email, I would have been confused about why no progress was made!</p>\n<p>At a midpoint in the process, Peter sent me a photograph of the painting he had done. From here, Instapainting created a fantastic platform to better explain to an artist any changes you may want to be made. I was fortunate to like what Peter did and not request any changes. However, for those who want to make changes, Instapainting allows you to create annotations to make your adjustments very clear to the artist.</p>\n<p>When I considered the painting finished, I marked it on the website and told Peter I was ready for it! He responded that the painting would be shipped as soon as it was dry. This process took 7 days for him to ship it. I was definitely not in a rush, but be aware that this can add significant time to your order’s process.</p>\n<p>The painting arrived very carefully packaged, with a lot of attention to detail to ensure nothing was damaged in the process. I was beside myself with how much I loved the painting, it was absolutely beautiful! Even more detailed in person, with Peter masterfully capturing my dog’s expression and personality. I quickly framed the canvas and am thoroughly enjoying this gorgeous artwork! I think my pup might be too!</p>\n<h3>Pros &amp; Cons</h3>\n<div class="su-row"><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#006600;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#009906;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Easy process &amp;

You can also leave notes for the artist on what you’d like added or changed, and keep in full communication.</p>\n<p>That being said, as this is a painting, there are limitations, and the artist will inform you of them.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>About Instapainting</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764031" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-painting-on-a-shelf.jpg" alt="Instapainting Custom Oil Painting Review - painting on a shelf" width="1500" height="1126" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-painting-on-a-shelf.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-painting-on-a-shelf-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-painting-on-a-shelf-800x601.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-painting-on-a-shelf-768x577.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-painting-on-a-shelf-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-painting-on-a-shelf-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.instapainting.com/products/custphotoreal" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on Instapainting</span></a></div>\n<div class="su-table breed-table su-table-alternate">\n<table width="623">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Founding:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">In 2010 by Chris Chen in San Francisco, California</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>The Artists:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Instapainting has a large collection of artists</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Sourcing of the artists:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Artists from all over the world</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Shipping:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Free worldwide shipping on all orders</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Warranty:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Instapainting offers a money-back guarantee</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Is the Instapainting Custom Oil Painting a Good Value?</h2>\n<p>The short answer? Yes, absolutely!</p>\n<p>The long answer? Instapainting is a good value in two key ways:</p>\n<p>First, if you’ve ever tried to get a custom<a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-to-make-dog-paw-prints-with-paint" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> painting of your pet</a>, you probably know how complex the process can be. You have to find the artist and hope the artist knows how to run a business professionally. Wait times can be very long for these kinds of paintings. Instapainting has a huge network of artists that connect to you and take on full liability, so all of the above is no longer a part of the process. The simplicity is invaluable!</p>\n<p>Second, custom artwork can be costly &#8211; I am absolutely for artists charging what they see their work valued at, but this can cause art to be unattainable for many. Instapainting keeps prices very affordable and has a payment plan available.</p>\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n<p>I went on the Instapainting website and went through the process of ordering a custom oil painting of my pup, Lorelei. This involved:</p>\n<div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Picking the medium (I chose oil)</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Selecting a good size (my selection was 16&#8243; x 20&#8243;)</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Uploading reference material for the artist</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Adding any customizations I wanted</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Selecting my artist of choice</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Communicating with the artist and approving each step</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>I then received the painting in the mail and compared it to the artist&#8217;s proof I had digitally received!</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764028" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-progress.jpg" alt="Instapainting Custom Oil Painting Review - progress" width="1500" height="743" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-progress.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-progress-600x297.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-progress-800x396.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-progress-768x380.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Instapainting-Custom-Oil-Painting-Review-progress-250x124.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.instapainting.com/products/custphotoreal" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on Instapainting</span></a></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\n<h3>Are custom sizes available?</h3>\n<p>Yes! If the size you want isn’t on the list of options, you can request a custom size.</p>\n<h3>Can I have multiple pets painted on the same canvas?</h3>\n<p>Absolutely! You can pick up to <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/keeping-the-peace-in-a-multidog-household" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">7 pets to be painted</a>, ranging in price from an additional $21 to $260. The more pets you need painted, the larger the size of the painting you have to select.</p>\n<h3>Can cell phone quality photographs suffice?</h3>\n<p>The clearer the image, the better, but cell phone photographs are perfectly fine. These photos are just for the artist&#8217;s reference material so that they can see what your pet looks like.</p>\n<h3>What if you do not like your painting?</h3>\n<p>Instapainting holds the artists to a high standard, and as such, there should be frequent communication and proofing of the painting prior to the finished product being shipped to you. Should there be any trouble in the process, or the painting you receive does not match the quality you had been shown, Instapainting customer support is happy to help.

difficult, both physically and emotionally. This process is made infinitely harder when you don’t know what your dog is allergic to.</p>\n<p>And that’s exactly where EasyDNA’s Dog Allergy Test comes in.</p>\n<p>Unlike so many canine “allergy” tests out there, this option uses blood serum and IgE antibodies to test for 125 environmental and food allergies, not sensitivities or intolerances. This gives you the knowledge you need to make impactful changes to your dog’s life to help them overcome allergy symptoms like atopic dermatitis and chronic diarrhea so they can have more good days.</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to try this allergy test on my Dalmatian mix, Ragz, who nearly died of anaphylaxis from an unknown allergen when she was young. Find out if this comprehensive test was able to uncover Ragz’s mystery allergy, what it took to get results, and if it’s worth the investment in my full EasyDNA Dog Allergy Test product review, below.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764011" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-product-with-dog-bowls.jpg" alt="EasyDNA Dog Allergy Test Review - product with dog bowls" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-product-with-dog-bowls.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-product-with-dog-bowls-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-product-with-dog-bowls-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-product-with-dog-bowls-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-product-with-dog-bowls-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-product-with-dog-bowls-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://easy-dna.com/?afl=pangolia152" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on EasyDNA</span></a></div>\n<div class="su-table breed-table su-table-alternate">\n<table width="623">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Product Type:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Allergy test</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Best Suited For:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Dogs over one year of age</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Price Range:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Moderately expensive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Contents:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Collection kit, paperwork, instructions for you and your vet, prepaid return envelope</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Test Type:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Dry serum from blood draw</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Pre-Test Requirements:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Eight-hour fast recommended;

Not only was she dirty and covered in cuts and scrapes, but she had hives all over her body.</p>\n<p>At the time, I didn’t think much of it. But the question of what caused those hives would come up again four years later when Ragz went into anaphylactic shock without warning.</p>\n<p>My husband had just gotten home from work. When Ragz failed to run through the dog door to greet him, we instantly knew something was wrong. By the time we found her, she was lethargic and her gums were pale and tacky.</p>\n<p>After we got her to the emergency vet, she broke out in full-body hives. It took three hours, but the vets were able to stabilize her and save her life. Since that day, we have been living in fear, not knowing what could have caused her allergic reaction.</p>\n<p>Most owners of allergy-prone dogs don’t have to worry about anaphylaxis, but less-emergent allergy symptoms can be just as severe and difficult to live with. I have known dozens of dogs who have suffered from crippling dermatitis due to unknown allergies.</p>\n<p>For Ragz and so many other dogs out there, EasyDNA’s Dog Allergy Test offers answers. This is exactly why I didn’t hesitate to get the test done despite the extra steps involved.</p>\n<p>Unlike cheek swab allergy tests that rely on IgA and IgG antibodies and that can be done at home, this in-depth test uses the more reliable IgE antibody and requires a blood draw by a licensed veterinarian. This means that there are extra costs associated with this test. But it also means the results are more likely to reflect actual allergy issues that you can target to reduce your dog’s symptoms.</p>\n<p>It took some back and forth to get the blood draw scheduled with my vet simply because they were not familiar with this product. In the end, though, it only cost me $20 for them to do the draw, complete the sample, and mail it back to the lab for me.</p>\n<p>This cost can vary by vet and region, so I recommend calling around to get an idea of the price before purchasing the kit to make sure it&#8217;s a viable option for you.</p>\n<p>Once the test was mailed in, it took about a week for the lab to receive it. From there, it took another eight days for them to process it and email my results.</p>\n<p>I found the results to be very easy to interpret. At the top of the PDF, it gave a quick summary of the findings, including how many total allergen responses were recorded. It also broke down how many of these responses were Class I, Class II, and Class III.</p>\n<p>After that, each allergen tested was listed along with the response result and the correlating Class reaction. The seven pages of results I received also included some very neat information on possible cross-reactions common to the allergens that showed reactivity.</p>\n<p>Ragz reacted to five of the allergens that were tested—pork, wheat, oat, European dust mite, and alder/birch pollen. All of her reactions were low (Class I), which means they are less likely to cause a noticeable allergic reaction.</p>\n<p>While this test did not uncover the culprit that caused her mystery anaphylactic shock episode, it did provide some valuable insight. For one, it highlighted potential allergies to three common foods in our pet pantry: pork, wheat, and oats. I will definitely avoid feeding these to Ragz in the future.</p>\n<p>More importantly, I can see how this test would be incredibly valuable for a dog that suffers from ongoing food or environmental allergies.</p>\n<p>After receiving Ragz’s results, I immediately sent my friend a link to the product. Her dog has been battling endless itchy and inflamed skin with no known cause. I’m certain a test like this one would help her and her poor dog finally find some answers and some relief.</p>\n<h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>\n<div class="su-row"><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#006600;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#009906;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> 125 allergens tested</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> IgE antibody test</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Results are easy to interpret</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Comprehensive and accurate</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Not an intolerance test</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#8c0000;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#bf000a;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Cons</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Requires vet appointment</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Takes time to receive results</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764014" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-allergens-tested.jpg" alt="EasyDNA Dog Allergy Test Review - allergens tested" width="890" height="636" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-allergens-tested.jpg.webp 890w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-allergens-tested-600x429.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-allergens-tested-800x572.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-allergens-tested-768x549.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-allergens-tested-250x179.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://easy-dna.com/?afl=pangolia152" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on EasyDNA</span></a></div>\n<h3>Looks at IgE Antibodies</h3>\n<p>One of the key differences between this allergy test from EasyDNA and most others on the market is that it relies on IgE antibodies. This is opposed to IgA and IgG antibodies, which most other tests rely on.</p>\n<p>IgE antibodies are present in the blood and are responsible for immediate allergic reactions, including hives, itchiness, swelling, and anaphylaxis. IgA and IgG, on the other hand, are responsible for delayed reactions and can cause inflammation, fatigue, and chronic stomach issues (<a href="https://www.usbiotek.com/blog/ige-vs-igg-vs-iga-decoding-immunoglobulins-for-food-and-inhalant-responses" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>\n<p>In other words, testing for IgE antibodies reveals true allergies, while testing for IgA or IgG antibodies only reveals intolerances and sensitivities. While it can be helpful to test for intolerances to understand the cause of chronic issues like digestive upset or inflammation, these types of tests do not reveal actual allergens.</p>\n<p>Many tests that are marketed as “dog allergy tests” use a saliva sample. Because IgE is only present in small amounts in saliva, these tests rely primarily on IgA and IgG to determine reactivity. This means that these products actually detect sensitivities and intolerances, rather than true allergies.</p>\n<p>The allergy test from EasyDNA, on the other hand, requires a blood test and looks for IgE reactivity to determine true allergens.</p>\n<h3>125 Allergens Tested</h3>\n<p>The Dog Allergy Test by EasyDNA looks at 125 allergens to provide a comprehensive picture of your dog’s allergies. The allergens tested for include common food and environmental triggers from multiple categories, including:</p>\n<div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-warning" style="color:#BC4B52"></i> <strong>Protein</strong> &#8211; beef, chicken, lamb, fish, etc.</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-warning" style="color:#BC4B52"></i> <strong>Fruits and vegetables</strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-warning" style="color:#BC4B52"></i> <strong>Dairy and eggs</strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-warning" style="color:#BC4B52"></i> <strong>Grains</strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-warning" style="color:#BC4B52"></i> <strong>Animal </strong>&#8211; cat dander, feathers, etc</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-warning" style="color:#BC4B52"></i> <strong>Insects</strong> &#8211; bee venom, mites, fleas, etc.</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-warning" style="color:#BC4B52"></i> <strong>Mold</strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-warning" style="color:#BC4B52"></i> <strong>Grass, weed, and tree pollen</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>When you receive your results, you’ll get information on which of these 125 allergens your dog reacted to, as well as how severe the reaction was.</p>\n<p>Reactivity is rated on a scale from Class I to Class III, with III being the most severe response. While higher results are more likely to indicate a severe reaction, this isn’t always the case. What the rating really tells you is how reactive your dog’s antibodies are to that allergen.</p>\n<p>It’s possible for your dog’s immune system to react strongly to a substance without producing any physical symptoms of an allergic reaction. Similarly, it’s possible that a minor response could produce physical allergic reactions.</p>\n<p>The best approach to interpreting your dog’s results is to consider them along with their symptoms and adjust their diet and/or environment accordingly.</p>\n<h3>Requires a Veterinary Blood Draw</h3>\n<p>In order to get the dry serum sample necessary for EasyDNA to process your dog’s allergy test, you need to take them to your vet.</p>\n<p>Most vets charge a fee to do a blood draw, so be sure to call your vet before ordering your kit to find out how much this service will cost.</p>\n<p>When you first receive your DNA test in the mail, be sure to keep all the paperwork and instructions that come with it. Also, do not open the mylar envelope with the testing supplies. Instead, bring the envelope along with your completed paperwork, the instructions, and the return envelope to your vet&#8217;s office.</p>\n<p>Your vet will draw the blood sample, process it to extract the serum, complete the collection, and then mail it back to the lab for you.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>About EasyDNA</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764013" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-full-kit.jpg" alt="EasyDNA Dog Allergy Test Review - full kit" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-full-kit.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-full-kit-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-full-kit-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-full-kit-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-full-kit-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-full-kit-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://easy-dna.com/?afl=pangolia152" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on EasyDNA</span></a></div>\n<p>For over 15 years, EasyDNA has been providing accurate and reliable DNA and genetic testing.

EasyDNA also offers a sensitivity test, which is substantially less expensive than their allergy testing option.</p>\n<p>When comparing the Dog Allergy Test to actual pet allergy testing from competitors, you’ll find that EasyDNA is very competitively priced. Given this and the quality and reliability of their tests, we believe it is a good value.</p>\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n<p>I enlisted the help of my dog, Ragz, to test this product. I evaluated it by considering the aspects the typical customer would desire in a <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/how-does-allergy-testing-in-dogs-work-vet-answer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">dog allergy test</a>.</p>\n<p>I followed the instructions in the kit and took Ragz to the vet to get her blood drawn and had the vet complete and mail the sample as instructed. I then kept records of communications from EasyDNA to track the timeline between collection and results.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764015" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-Ragz-with-product.jpg" alt="EasyDNA Dog Allergy Test Review - Ragz with product" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-Ragz-with-product.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-Ragz-with-product-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-Ragz-with-product-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-Ragz-with-product-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-Ragz-with-product-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-Ragz-with-product-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://easy-dna.com/?afl=pangolia152" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on EasyDNA</span></a></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\n<h3>Who should use this product?</h3>\n<p>EasyDNA’s Dog Allergy Test is a great option for dogs whose allergy symptoms have not been relieved by changes in diet and environment. It is also a great option for dogs with a history of anaphylaxis and those who suffer from hives and other severe allergy symptoms without a known cause.</p>\n<h3>How long does it take for the test kit to arrive?</h3>\n<p>I received my kit in the mail about four days after I placed my order. It took one week for the sample to arrive at the lab after my vet mailed it, and another eight days for the lab to email me my results.</p>\n<h3>Does my dog need to fast before the sample is collected?</h3>\n<p>EasyDNA <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/fasting-for-dogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">recommends your dog fasts</a> for 8 hours before getting their blood drawn, but this is not mandatory for this test.</p>\n<h3>Should I stop my dog’s medications before testing?</h3>\n<p>Antihistamines, anti-inflammatories, and anti-itch medications can all affect the results of this test. EasyDNA recommends that you stop these meds one to two weeks before collecting the sample.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764016" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-panel-with-directions.jpg" alt="EasyDNA Dog Allergy Test Review - panel with directions" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-panel-with-directions.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-panel-with-directions-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-panel-with-directions-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-panel-with-directions-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-panel-with-directions-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EasyDNA-Dog-Allergy-Test-Review-panel-with-directions-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://easy-dna.com/?afl=pangolia152" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on EasyDNA</span></a></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If your<a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/allergy-bumps-on-dogs-vet-answer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> dog has been battling allergy symptoms</a> like hives, itchy skin, or anaphylaxis, and you’re unsure of the cause, <a href="https://easy-dna.com/?afl=pangolia152" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">EasyDNA’s Dog Allergy Test</a> is here to provide answers.</p>\n<p>This comprehensive blood serum test looks at IgE reactivity to 125 different environmental and food compounds to determine your dog’s true allergens.

Ragz, my 14-year-old Dalmatian mix, struggles with sore joints in her old age. And my 16-year-old Chihuahua, Papyrus, has some arthritis in his back legs, anxiety, and trouble sleeping now that he’s older.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that quality CBD oil really has a profound effect on these issues, helping both my dogs find relief. Unfortunately, with both dogs requiring therapeutic doses of the stuff twice every day, the cost can quickly add up. Because of this, I’m always on the lookout for well-priced, quality pet CBD options.</p>\n<p>And that’s why I was so excited to try this tincture from The Brothers Apothecary.</p>\n<p>Not only is this CBD oil made from simple quality ingredients, but it’s also a high-concentration formula and very affordable. All in all, this product looks great on paper, but I still had to put it to the test to find out if it was as effective as advertised.</p>\n<h3>What I Liked</h3>\n<p>To start, I’m a big fan of the ingredients that make up this CBD oil tincture. I also LOVE the price.</p>\n<p>Calming K-9 CBD Oil contains only full spectrum hemp extract, MCT oil, and French-style peanut butter oil. There are zero filler ingredients, and the taste used is all-natural and potent.</p>\n<p>I’ve already mentioned how affordable this oil is, which is why I was so surprised to learn that each bottle has an impressive 500mg of CBD. For pet CBD oil, this is a fairly high concentration. And for a dog owner who goes through a lot of CBD, it’s exactly what I like to see.</p>\n<p>Not only do high-concentration formulas make for less added oil in your dog’s meals, but the bottles also last a lot longer, which means even more cost savings.</p>\n<p>I added this product to my dogs&#8217; meals twice a day at their typical therapeutic dose (15mg for Ragz, and 4mg for Papyrus). They had been off CBD for a few months due to some backorder issues with my usual brand, which provided the perfect environment to test this oil.</p>\n<p>I first noticed results after about two weeks of continual use. Both dogs appeared less stiff and sore in the morning. There was also a clear difference in their mobility on walks starting around this time.</p>\n<p>I have been using it for three weeks now and have just started to notice a difference in Papyrus’ anxiety. He seems calmer throughout the day and is sleeping much more soundly overnight. I’m hopeful that these effects will continue to build over the next couple of weeks.</p>\n<h3>Where I Saw Room for Improvement</h3>\n<p>Honestly, there isn’t much I don’t love about this CBD oil. And my dogs seem to agree.</p>\n<p>They happily eat it when I mix it in with their food. And will swallow it when I put it directly in their mouth, though this is not their favorite method of administration.</p>\n<p>I only ran into two issues with this product.</p>\n<p>First, I had a bit of trouble with the dropper. It has volume markers on the pipette, which makes measuring the correct amount super easy. However, for some reason, squeezing the rubber bulb doesn’t fully empty the pipette.</p>\n<p>This was problematic when trying to give Papyrus his small dose. I haven’t had this issue with other CBD oils, but it’s possible this is an uncommon defect that others won’t experience.</p>\n<p>The other issue I ran into was finding the third-party lab results for the batch I received on the company’s webpage. The QR code on the bottle only brings me to the lab results home page and there is no category listed for “pet oils” or “tinctures.” When I was not able to locate the batch number even after sifting through all the lab results on the page, I contacted The Brothers Apothecary through their Contact Me page and using the phone number on their website. It took about a week to hear back but I did receive the information I was looking for.</p>\n<p>Despite these minor issues, I have been really impressed with this company and this product and will continue to use it. At this price, how could I not?!</p>\n<h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>\n<div class="su-row"><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#006600;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#009906;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> High concentration</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Simple ingredients</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Full spectrum</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Natural peanut oil for flavor</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Easy to dose</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Great price</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#8c0000;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#bf000a;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Cons</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Not certified organic</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Only one option available</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-763990" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-product-dropper.jpg" alt="The Brothers Apothecary Calming K-9 CBD Oil Review -

It is derived from hemp flowers and contains a full spectrum of terpenes, flavonoids, and cannabinoids, including plenty of CBD. It does contain trace amounts of THC, but at just 0.08%, this amount is well below the recommended maximum of 0.3%.</p>\n<p>While CBD is the compound in hemp that has the most well-understood medicinal applications, many of the lesser-known substances in this product are just as important. These minor cannabinoids, flavonoids, and terpenes all contribute to the entourage effect and help CBD work more effectively. Many of them also have their own benefits.</p>\n<p>The carrier oil used in this product is medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil. This is an optimal carrier oil because it does a wonderful job of protecting fragile hemp compounds while making them easier for the body to absorb. MCT also has a fairly neutral taste that most dogs enjoy.</p>\n<p>To help make this product even more palatable, natural peanut oil is added. Unlike a lot of flavored CBD oils, the French-style peanut oil is quite potent. This single-ingredient oil is unrefined, expeller-pressed, lightly filtered, and would be a favorite for many dogs.</p>\n<p>You can easily smell the peanut butter when you use this product. In the name of providing a thorough review, I also tasted it, and I can tell you the peanut butter does a pretty good job of covering up the natural taste of hemp oil.</p>\n<h3>High Concentration for Therapeutic Dosing</h3>\n<p>The Brothers Apothecary Calming K-9 CBD Oil is only available in one size and concentration. Each bottle is 30ml and contains 500mg of CBD. This breaks out to about 16.7mg of CBD per dropper.</p>\n<p>The general recommendation for CBD dosing in dogs is 1 to 5mg per 10 lbs of body weight. For pain management in my dogs, I use the higher end of the dosing spectrum, known as a therapeutic dose.</p>\n<p>Many dog CBD oils contain less than 1mg of CBD per ml, which means you have to use quite a bit to reach a therapeutic dose. This is especially true if you have a large dog. The high concentration of this product makes it a great, more cost-effective option for therapeutic dosing and dosing large dogs.</p>\n<h3>How to Use</h3>\n<p>Like most CBD oil tinctures, this one can be given directly to your dog or mixed in with their food.</p>\n<p>The advantage of direct dosing is that the CBD is absorbed into the body much more quickly, which means you&#8217;ll see the effects faster. If you are using the oil to help your dog stay calm before a stressful event, I recommend dosing this way. Luckily, the peanut oil makes it quite a bit more palatable for this type of administration.</p>\n<p>You can also add this oil to your dog&#8217;s meals for easier dosing.</p>\n<p>Depending on your dog’s needs, you may want to dose them once or twice per day. CBD has a cumulative effect, which means you will see more consistent results the more often you use it.</p>\n<p>The calming effects of this product are generally obvious within about 30 to 45 minutes of giving it to your dog. These results will get more pronounced with consistent use, with peak results after about two weeks. This is about the time I noticed the product affecting my dogs’ mobility, as well. You can expect full results after about three to six weeks.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>About The Brothers Apothecary</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-763992" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-product-with-flowers-in-the-background.jpg" alt="The Brothers Apothecary Calming K-9 CBD Oil Review - product with flowers in the background" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-product-with-flowers-in-the-background.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-product-with-flowers-in-the-background-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-product-with-flowers-in-the-background-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-product-with-flowers-in-the-background-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-product-with-flowers-in-the-background-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-product-with-flowers-in-the-background-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.thebrothersapothecary.com/product/calming-k9-cbd-oil-for-dogs/" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on The Brothers Apothecary</span></a></div>\n<p>The Brothers Apothecary was founded in 2015 with the mission to offer the benefits of CBD in a healthier, more synergetic way.

It costs about the same as the lowest-priced quality CBD oils I’ve tested while having a higher concentration, making it an incredibly good value.</p>\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n<p>I tested this product the same way I&#8217;ve tested the dozens of other pet CBD tinctures I have reviewed—with the help of my dogs.</p>\n<p>I dosed them twice daily with their typical therapeutic dose. I primarily added the oil to their food but also tried dosing it directly by putting it into their mouths to see how they would tolerate it. I continued using the product for three full weeks before writing this review.</p>\n<p>I also spent ample time researching The Brothers Apothecary, their products, methods, and sourcing. I studied their third-party lab tests and extraction methods. Additionally, I called on my extensive knowledge of CBD and hemp products to determine how this option ranks against similar products on the market.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-763991" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-putting-product-on-food.jpg" alt="The Brothers Apothecary Calming K-9 CBD Oil Review - putting product on food" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-putting-product-on-food.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-putting-product-on-food-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-putting-product-on-food-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-putting-product-on-food-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-putting-product-on-food-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-Brothers-Apothecary-Calming-K-9-CBD-Oil-Review-putting-product-on-food-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.thebrothersapothecary.com/product/calming-k9-cbd-oil-for-dogs/" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on The Brothers Apothecary</span></a></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\n<h3>How much Calm K-9 CBD Oil should I give my dog?</h3>\n<p>The Brothers Apothecary recommends a dose of 5mg for <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/best-behaved-small-dogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">small dogs</a>, 10mg for medium dogs, and 16mg for <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/large-dog-breeds-for-first-time-dog-owners" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">large dogs</a>.

Every Wednesday, we share a story from one of our Dogsters. This week is about Nicole and her two rescue dogs, Mac and Rosa.</strong></p>\n<p>From the moment we wake up on my daughter’s swimming lesson day, the dogs go crazy. It makes sense that they would know when they saw the swimming bag, but I swear they have a secret calendar somewhere that lets them know before we wake up. Usually, they’re the last to wake, but on swimming day, they’re waking us.</p>\n<p>Why? Because it’s <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/is-doggy-daycare-good-for-every-dog" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">doggy daycare day</a>.</p>\n<p>Our dogs are spoiled at home, but their daycare is next level. Sometimes, there are 15-20 big dogs running free in a farm-based, fully fenced yard with banana trees, gardens, chickens, pigs, and even a mud pit. I don’t know how the owners do it; they are true dog whisperers, and everyone lives in harmony.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764001" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764001" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-764001" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-mud-pit_Nicole.jpg" alt="The mud pit!" width="522" height="640" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-mud-pit_Nicole.jpg.webp 522w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-mud-pit_Nicole-489x600.jpg.webp 489w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-mud-pit_Nicole-250x307.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764001" class="wp-caption-text">The mud pit!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>We are incredibly lucky that our neighbors run a doggy daycare, and we truly don’t know how we would survive without them. Rosa and Mac are happier, healthier, and more social, and we get to enjoy their tired, content (and dirty) faces at the end of the day. When our daughter was born, they stayed for a week. They are part of the furniture there, and we often joke that they’d prefer to live there—but can you blame them? Free range dogs, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/raw-dog-food-benefits-and-deficiencies-vet-answer" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">fed raw food</a>, and permission to jump in the mud. It’s more like a doggy day spa!</p>\n<p>During one lengthy stay, Rosa actually got herself stuck in one of the fences, I think she was a bit more slim when she arrived, but even then, she had no chance of fitting her big fluffy butt through. There must have been some delicious treats on the other side of the fence.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764000" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764000" style="width: 536px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-764000 size-medium" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rosa-in-the-fence_Nicole-536x600.jpg" alt="Rosa stuck in the fence" width="536" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rosa-in-the-fence_Nicole-536x600.jpg.webp 536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rosa-in-the-fence_Nicole-250x280.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rosa-in-the-fence_Nicole-600x671.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rosa-in-the-fence_Nicole.jpg.webp 638w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764000" class="wp-caption-text">Rosa stuck in the fence</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I’m not entirely sure what they do all day, but we get photo updates that usually consist of Mac in the water and playing with the dogs and Rosa off in her own world somewhere, chasing the butterflies or taking care of the piggies.</p>\n<p>When we first took Rosa there before we had Mac, she didn’t really engage with the other dogs, which was the whole reason we brought her there. A year later, when we took her and Mac back together, she was a different dog. Even though she still plays on her own quite a bit, she has friendships and loves watching the other dogs play.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764003" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764003" style="width: 524px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-764003" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Nurse-Rosa-licking-the-big-pig-who-had-an-injured-ear_Nicole.jpg" alt="Nurse Rosa licking the big pig who had an injured ear" width="524" height="512" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Nurse-Rosa-licking-the-big-pig-who-had-an-injured-ear_Nicole.jpg.webp 524w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Nurse-Rosa-licking-the-big-pig-who-had-an-injured-ear_Nicole-250x244.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764003" class="wp-caption-text">Nurse Rosa licking the big pig who had an injured ear</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Mac is Mr Popular and is friends with everyone, and often involves his sister in the games.</p>\n<p>It’s so insane, as I write this, how much this sounds like two human children at a childcare centre. They have social groups, mealtimes, rest times, and crazy play times. We share how they’ve been and what to look out for in the morning when we drop them off, and we ask ‘How were they?’ every time we pick them up.

It also contains blueberries for antioxidant support, dried chicory for prebiotic support and healthy digestion, and chelated minerals and essential vitamins. Lastly, this food is free from grains and artificial colors, preservatives, and flavors, and it is made in the U.S.A. from trusted and sustainable local and global sources.</p>\n<p>While this food does have a high protein content that comes mostly from novel sources, some of the protein content also comes from the included peas. Peas and their inclusion in grain-free diets are currently being investigated by the FDA as a potential link to heart disease in dogs.

Ingredients are crucial to consider, though, and learning to read the ingredient list properly is important.</p>\n<p>A quality protein source should be the first listed ingredient and should be sourced from an animal, such as chicken or beef. Being the first ingredient on the list ensures that this is what constitutes the majority of the food, so you’ll ideally want it to be animal-based. At least one of the first three ingredients should be from an animal source. It can get tricky, though, as whole meats tend to have a large amount of water content by weight, which is reduced after processing. Meat meals actually contain more whole meats overall due to having less water weight. It’s a good idea to check the overall protein content, but even this can be skewed by other proteins within the recipe, which is why it’s a good idea to go with a trusted brand.</p>\n<p>You’ll also want the food to contain a complete balance of nutrients, like <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/sources-of-omega-3-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">omega fatty acids</a>, vitamins, and minerals, and healthy fruits and vegetables, like whole grains, sweet potatoes, carrots, and blueberries.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_680449" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-680449" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-680449" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Havanese-dog-eating_Boryana-Manzurova_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Havanese dog eating" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Havanese-dog-eating_Boryana-Manzurova_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Havanese-dog-eating_Boryana-Manzurova_Shutterstock-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Havanese-dog-eating_Boryana-Manzurova_Shutterstock-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Havanese-dog-eating_Boryana-Manzurova_Shutterstock-250x167.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-680449" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Boryana Manzurova, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Lifestage and Breeds</h3>\n<p>Some dry dog foods are made for dogs of all ages and breeds, while others are specifically catered toward small or large breeds, puppies, seniors, or dogs with specific health issues. <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/puppy-vs-adult-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Puppy food has a different nutritional profile than adult food</a>, so you’ll want to stick to these foods if you have a puppy. Also, foods formulated for small breeds have small kibble that is easy to chew. Try to stick to foods made for your dog’s breed, age, and size.</p>\n<h3>How much should you feed your dog?</h3>\n<p>With canine obesity becoming such a widespread problem in the United States, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/how-many-times-a-day-should-dog-eat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">it’s vital to avoid overfeeding your pooch</a>. It helps to avoid free-feeding your pooch, as few dogs can regulate their food intake. While it’s a good idea to follow the guidelines on the food packaging, those are just that — guidelines. The amount of food that you give your dog will also depend on their age, activity levels, and size. <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/golden-rules-feeding-your-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">You’ll need to use the guidelines and your discretion to determine the correct amount</a> and then adjust accordingly.</p>\n<p>We recommend splitting your dog’s meals into two, as this can help avoid bloating caused by fast eating or overeating.<span data-sheets-root="1"><br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span data-sheets-root="1"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716646" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 2 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></span></p>\n<h2>Our Selection Process For Dry Dog Foods</h2>\n<p>To create this buyer&#8217;s guide, our writing team and editorial staff checked customer reviews, brand reputation, and veterinary approval ratings to present the dry dog foods we think should be highlighted for our readers.

With this food, you can choose from a pack of either 12 or 24, 2.5-ounce cups of food. There are also three different flavors to choose from: chicken &amp; beef, chicken &amp; turkey, or chicken &amp; lamb. Or, you can choose a variety pack of flavors so you can switch things up for your dog.</p>\n<p>Each of these recipes has real meat as the first ingredient, and they are easy to serve to your dog.

We go over a few points that are worth considering before you make your purchase.</p>\n<h3>Flavor</h3>\n<p>If your dog enjoys certain flavors and not others, you should avoid variety packs. On the other hand, if you have a new dog and still haven’t figured out their likes and dislikes, a variety pack is a great way to experiment so you can figure out your dog’s favorites.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_45461" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45461" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-45461" src="https://dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/labrador-retriever-eating-dog-food_Jaromir-Chalabala_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="labrador retriever eating dog food" width="810" height="540" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45461" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Jaromir Chalabala, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<p>Most pet owners <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/how-to-choose-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">don’t bother reading the ingredient list</a>, but this is a great habit to get into. If you’re not too concerned about what is in your dog’s food and they don’t have any health issues, you can choose to read the ingredients or not. But many manufacturers include ingredients that you might want to avoid. The rule of thumb is that the first five ingredients should be whole ingredients and real meat.</p>\n<p>If you need veterinary advice over your dog&#8217;s nutrition, we recommend speaking with a vet.</p>\n<p><span data-sheets-root="1"><p><div class="su-box su-box-style-default pangovet-mention-box" id="" style="border-color:#003e92;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#0971c5;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">💛 🐶 Speak To a Vet Online From the Comfort of Your Couch!</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3542157 chewy-in-content-image" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PangoVet_Mention-in-Content_v10_Oct-18-2024-copy.png" alt="PangoVet" width="375" /></p>\r\n<p style="font-weight: 500; text-align: center; line-height: 1.5; font-size: medium !important; margin-bottom: 20px;">If you need to speak with a vet but can&#8217;t get to one, head over to <a href="https://pangovet.com?utm_source=dogster&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=dog-nutrition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><b>PangoVet</b></a>.

As with human foods, some ingredients are best to be avoided completely.</p>\n<p><strong>Butylated Hydroxyanisole</strong> (BHA) is a chemical preservative that gets added to fats and oils. Even small amounts of BHA can be harmful to your dog’s health. The Centers for Disease Control even say that BHA is carcinogenic for humans and <a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/content/profiles/butylatedhydroxyanisole.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">studies show</a> that it can act the same in animals.</p>\n<p><strong>White flour</strong> is highly treated and stripped of most of its nutrients during processing. Its main function in dog food is to act as a binder and to add texture.</p>\n<p><strong>Meat meal</strong> is any unlabeled meat ingredient in your dog’s food. Companies tend to be very vague about what this ingredient is, which should raise red flags right from the get-go. These meats are usually made with low-quality, expired, or even infected meat. Meat meal can also contain fatty tissues, and dead animal remains. The purpose of this ingredient in dog food is to act as a filler. It has almost no protein and quality control is difficult to, well, control.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial colors</strong> are used a lot in human food to make food look more appealing. The presence of fake coloring in animal food is completely unnecessary. We don’t need to find the appearance of our dog’s food to be appealing. All that matters is that your dog finds it appealing, and chances are he will put a lot more stock into the scent and texture of the food than its color.</p>\n<p><strong>Farmed salmon</strong> might sound like a healthy ingredient to have in your pup’s food, but it’s not. Many dogs are interested in eating fish, salmon included. Farmed salmon, though, can include harmful toxins that can be dangerous for your pup. Farmed salmon, including salmon meal and oil, can add high levels of mercury and other fat-soluble toxins into their diet. This type of salmon can contain <a href="https://www.onemedical.com/blog/eat-well/farmed-salmon/#:~:text=The%20majority%20of,develop%20it%20naturally)." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">toxic chemicals</a> and cancer-causing PCBs.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_169452" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169452" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-169452" src="https://dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/close-up-of-a-dog-eating-from-the-bowl_Dmytro-Zinkevych_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="close up of a dog eating from the bowl" width="810" height="540" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-169452" class="wp-caption-text">Image By: Dmytro Zinkevych, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Read Everything</h3>\n<p>Always double-check every aspect of the food before you buy it. Is it pâté or shredded? Does it contain real, whole meat, or just flavors? If your <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/best-canned-wet-dog-food-for-sensitive-stomachs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">dog is sensitive to specific ingredients</a>, like chicken, make sure it doesn’t include any.</p>\n<h3>Size</h3>\n<p>The larger your dog, the more you have to buy. Aim for large cans because they won’t sit in the fridge for long, and you’ll get one or two servings from each can. You should aim for small containers for your small dogs. If you purchase 13-ounce cans for your Chihuahua, they will end up sitting in the fridge for a long time. The size of the can/container should be relative to the size of your dog and how much they can eat in one meal.</p>\n<h3>Is Wet Food Better Than Dry Food?</h3>\n<p><a href="https://petkeen.com/how-much-wet-food-should-you-feed-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Wet food</a> can sometimes provide more benefits for your dog than dry food.</p>\n<p>Wet foods have a higher moisture content, which is very beneficial for dogs who might not drink as much water as they should. It’s also great for dogs with certain medical conditions that necessitate a proper amount of hydration, like kidney disease.</p>\n<p>Canned food also tends to be more palatable to most dogs. It has aromas that dry food does not and may also be more flavorful. Offering wet foods is <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/how-much-canned-food-to-feed-a-dog" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">a great way to entice your dog to eat</a> if they’re sick or have a low appetite.</p>\n<p>Wet foods can help increase satiety. This is beneficial for dogs who need assistance with weight loss as it will help them feel fuller for longer after meals. Finally, wet foods are, by nature, simpler to chew. If your dog has dental disease or other oral concerns, he might be more apt to eat wet food because of how easy it is to eat.</p>\n<p>Now, that’s not to say that dry food doesn’t have its list of benefits. It can be more convenient as portioning it out is easier. Dry food is often more affordable and can work well as a food enrichment item in puzzle toys and automatic feeders.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_120246" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-120246" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-120246" src="https://dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dog-automatic-feeder_muslody.com-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="dog automatic feeder" width="810" height="540" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-120246" class="wp-caption-text">Image By: muslody.com, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Our Selection Process For Canned &amp; Wet Dog Foods</h2>\n<p>To create this buyer&#8217;s guide, our writing team and editorial staff checked customer reviews, brand reputation, and veterinary approval ratings to present the dog foods we think should be highlighted for our readers.

Lava is generally a barker, but only when there is some excitement going on or someone’s come to visit. She will also bark at other dogs, particularly if she can’t get close to them, as a sign of frustration and reactivity. And after living with Lava for almost two years, Hela has taken on some of her more annoying characteristics, as well as perfected her own barking skills. Lajka seems to be a category of her own, to my surprise.</p>\n<h2>Someone Needs to Keep Watch, Right?</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-763734 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Miki-Lajka-Lava-and-Hela-on-a-pathway_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg" alt="Miki, Lajka, Lava, and Hela on a pathway" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Miki-Lajka-Lava-and-Hela-on-a-pathway_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Miki-Lajka-Lava-and-Hela-on-a-pathway_Dr-Maja-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Miki-Lajka-Lava-and-Hela-on-a-pathway_Dr-Maja-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Miki-Lajka-Lava-and-Hela-on-a-pathway_Dr-Maja-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Miki-Lajka-Lava-and-Hela-on-a-pathway_Dr-Maja-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Miki-Lajka-Lava-and-Hela-on-a-pathway_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>Lava and Hela are true protectors. That is if I needed protection from passing cars, people, dogs, wildlife, and birds high up in the skies. They take their job pretty seriously. And they work in shifts. If one is inside, the other one is barking for both of them. And if they are both outside, it’s a competition to see who will be the loudest. Now, Lava used to be a moderate barker, but in the last two years, living in the countryside with lots of things happening all the time and wild animals passing by, she progressed to a proper barker. Now Hela takes it a step further. With her unique experience of living in Greece, she is very reactive to loud noises made by cars, trucks, tractors, and any kind of machinery. She also learned from Lava that large predator birds should not be flying above our land and makes it her mission to get them to leave our airspace immediately. When it comes to the newest addition, Lajka, I had higher hopes for her barking, but now I see that I underestimated her.</p>\n<h2>It All Seemed Fine to Begin With</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-763730 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-lying-on-the-carpet_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg" alt="Lajka lying on the carpet" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-lying-on-the-carpet_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-lying-on-the-carpet_Dr-Maja-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-lying-on-the-carpet_Dr-Maja-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-lying-on-the-carpet_Dr-Maja-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-lying-on-the-carpet_Dr-Maja-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-lying-on-the-carpet_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Lajka joined our family at the end of last year, and she&#8217;s been living with us for almost three full months now. She settled in very well, accepted the two dogs and the three cats, and actually very quickly started to behave as if she&#8217;d always lived here. She will not roam far from the house, and I can just let her explore on her own terms. She doesn&#8217;t like to be on the lead, which I respect, and I let her off the lead as I know she&#8217;s always paying attention to where I am, never getting too far away from the front door. But one thing I didn&#8217;t think of was her barking. Despite being the smallest dog in the house, she certainly wins the title of the loudest and most penetrating barker. Or in her eyes, the most fierce protector of the realm.</p>\n<p>Well, initially <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/do-dogs-think-cats-are-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">she barked at the cats</a>, which took a few days to stop when she realized they weren’t that scary. And then we had a good first month of silence. Then she started barking mainly when she got very excited and happy, just before mealtimes. But in the last few weeks, her barking has become very frequent. She&#8217;s obviously had a serious talk with Lava and Hela and realized she needs to step up.</p>\n<h2>There’s a But</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-763732 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Lava-playing-on-a-long-stick_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg" alt="Lajka and Lava playing on a long stick" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Lava-playing-on-a-long-stick_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Lava-playing-on-a-long-stick_Dr-Maja-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Lava-playing-on-a-long-stick_Dr-Maja-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Lava-playing-on-a-long-stick_Dr-Maja-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Lava-playing-on-a-long-stick_Dr-Maja-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-and-Lava-playing-on-a-long-stick_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>Barking is all fine, if directed towards an actual threat, like a scary bird up high in the skies, that can barely be made out without a spying glass. But what is becoming more frustrating is her barking at Lava. When Lava is on a very long lead, it’s as if Lajka doesn&#8217;t seem to approve. She even grabs the lead, pulls her around, and does the same to Hela. But with Hela, she&#8217;s developed a more affectionate relationship, and the two of them will play constantly and even sleep next to one another. With Lava, it&#8217;s a little bit different because Lava is more of an independent, scary, and grumpy character. She likes me and she tolerates the two dogs and the cats, but she prefers her privacy. So whether Lava is <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-communication" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">exhibiting body language that Lajka doesn&#8217;t understand</a> or that confuses her or even scares her, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. But, it’s becoming a nuisance, and it’s a very high-pitched sound that resonates.</p>\n<h3>Patience and Time</h3>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-763733 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-Hela-and-Miki-out-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg" alt="Lajka, Hela, and Miki out in the field" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-Hela-and-Miki-out-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-Hela-and-Miki-out-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-Hela-and-Miki-out-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-Hela-and-Miki-out-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-Hela-and-Miki-out-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lajka-Hela-and-Miki-out-in-the-field_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>Thinking back, maybe this was one of the reasons why Lajka’s previous owner may have abandoned her. It could have been her <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/hunting-dog-games" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">inadequate hunting instincts</a> or a very loud bark that may have scared away the game. At this time, I have decided to try distracting her from barking, and rewarding her with my attention and praise when she doesn’t bark at all. If she barks, I do my best to ignore it, and try and get all the dogs walking, because as soon as we’re on the move, the barking ceases. Part of it must also be excitement that she doesn’t yet know how to contain. Luckily, we live in the middle of nowhere, so nobody minds the noise. But it’s difficult when they’re barking to know if it’s all just for fun or if there is actually something going on. I also need to keep reminding myself that Lajka has only been here a few months and is yet to fully settle, so I am hopeful this behavior will reduce further with time.</p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#00285e;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#1E5B91;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article is a part of Dr. Maja, Lava and Hela's series.</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#FAA41A"></i> <strong>Read her previous article: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/dogs-and-sleeping-arrangements-whats-mine-is-theirs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Dogs and Sleeping Arrangements: What’s Mine Is Theirs</a><br />\n</strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#FAA41A"></i> <strong>Read her next article: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/doggy-couch-wars-the-battle-for-comfort" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Doggy Couch Wars: The Battle for Comfort</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/dogs-and-barking-getting-lava-hela-lajka-to-stop">Dogs and Barking: Getting Lava, Hela &#038; Lajka to Stop</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-maja-platisa">Dr. Maja Platisa DVM MRCVS (Veterinarian)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

My Dog and I Can&#8217;t Afford Vet Care!</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Dear Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I really don’t have the money to care for my pet. My dog Goodie has a heart murmur but medical expenses are high, what can I do? I really need help and I’m so scared for him.” </strong>&#8211; Uriah</p></blockquote>\n<p>I completely understand how overwhelming this situation must feel, Uriah. Loving a pet like Goodie means wanting to do everything possible to keep him healthy, but financial barriers can make that incredibly stressful. The good news is that there are still ways to get him the care he needs.</p>\n<p>First, I recommend reaching out to local animal shelters, humane societies, or veterinary schools. Many offer low-cost clinics or financial assistance programs for pet owners in difficult situations. Some veterinarians also offer payment plans or work with organizations like CareCredit, which provides financing options for medical expenses. Additionally, nonprofit groups such as <a href="https://www.thepetfund.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">The Pet Fund</a>, <a href="https://redrover.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">RedRover</a>, or <a href="https://www.browndogfoundation.org/ask-for-help" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">The Brown Dog Foundation</a> may offer grants or assistance for pets with medical conditions like Goodie’s.</p>\n<p>Since Goodie has a heart murmur, his needs will depend on the severity of the condition. Some murmurs are mild and don’t require immediate treatment, while others need medication to prevent complications. If you haven’t already, ask a veterinarian if there are affordable management options or lifestyle adjustments that could help him stay comfortable.

My Dogs Don&#8217;t Stop Barking!</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span style="font-size: 17.6px;">&#8220;</span>Hi Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>My dogs Moseley, Rev, and Pickles bark incessantly, and it doesn&#8217;t matter what I say or do. They also howl together! They always start barking when I get on the phone. When someone comes to the door. If someone drives by on our lane. It could most certainly be worse cuz I&#8217;ve seen and heard, but how do I make it better?&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Corinne</p></blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like Moseley, Rev, and Pickles have developed a habit of barking and howling together, likely reinforcing each other’s excitement or alertness. Barking is a natural canine behavior, but when it becomes excessive, it’s often a mix of instinct, habit, and learned behavior. In their case, it seems to be triggered by external stimuli like people passing by, visitors at the door, and even your phone conversations. This suggests both territorial alert barking and attention-seeking behavior.</p>\n<p>Since they don’t seem to respond to verbal corrections, they may not understand what you want from them in those moments. Instead of trying to stop the barking directly, focus on teaching an alternative behavior. For example, you can <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/how-to-train-a-dog-to-stop-barking" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">train</a> a reliable “quiet” cue by first rewarding them when they pause naturally and then gradually pairing it with a verbal command. If they bark when people approach, redirect their focus to a specific spot, like a mat or bed, where they can be rewarded for calm behavior. Practicing impulse control exercises, such as “<a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/how-to-teach-your-dog-to-sit" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">sit</a> and <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/how-to-teach-a-dog-to-stay" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">stay</a>” with distractions, will also help.</p>\n<p>For phone-triggered barking, they may have learned that barking gets your attention when you&#8217;re distracted. Try giving them a special, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/best-long-lasting-dog-chews" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">long-lasting chew</a> or food puzzle before you make a call, so they associate your phone time with quiet engagement. Consistency is key—if all three dogs are reinforcing each other, training them separately first may be necessary before bringing them together. With patience and positive reinforcement, you can help them channel their energy into more appropriate behaviors while still allowing them to express themselves when it truly matters.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Dr. Paola</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716646" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 2 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<figure id="attachment_609110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-609110" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-609110" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dachshund-dog-near-trash-can_Masarik-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="Dachshund dog near trash can" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dachshund-dog-near-trash-can_Masarik-Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dachshund-dog-near-trash-can_Masarik-Shutterstock-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dachshund-dog-near-trash-can_Masarik-Shutterstock-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dachshund-dog-near-trash-can_Masarik-Shutterstock-250x167.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-609110" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Masarik, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Help! My Dog Ingested Glass!</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Hi Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hazel threw up in the night, which consisted of little shards of a Corningware glass that had cranberry sauce in it that broke. I immediately cleaned it up with paper towels, but the little scavenger she is got into the trash. Can I give her Pepto Bisol or something to help her? There is no blood.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Suzie</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Suzie, I’m so sorry Hazel got into the trash and <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/my-dog-ate-glass" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">ingested glass</a>. Even though she isn’t showing any immediate concerning signs like blood in the vomit, this is still a situation that requires veterinary attention. Ingesting glass can cause internal cuts or irritation in her mouth, esophagus, stomach, or intestines, even if she seems fine right now. The biggest concern is that small shards could cause internal damage as they move through her digestive system.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/can-dogs-have-pepto-bismol" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Pepto-Bismol</a> is <strong>not recommended</strong> in this case, as it won’t protect against any potential internal injury and could mask signs that a veterinarian needs to assess. Instead, it’s best to contact your veterinarian as soon as possible. They may recommend an exam, X-rays, or feeding a bulk-forming diet (such as plain <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/what-does-pumpkin-do-for-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">canned pumpki</a>n or soft bread) to help cushion any remaining fragments. Keep a close eye on Hazel for signs of discomfort, vomiting, lack of appetite, or difficulty defecating, and avoid giving any over-the-counter medications unless advised by a vet. Since this could be an urgent situation, an online <a href="https://pangovet.com/general/pet-telehealth/?utm_source=catster&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=ask-dr-paola-pet-telehealth/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">teletriage veterinary service</a> like our own service, PangoVet.com may be helpful to assess her risk level if you can’t get to a clinic immediately.</p>\n<p>All the best,</p>\n<p>Dr. Paola</p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#004288;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#2575bb;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article is a part of our weekly Ask Dr. Paola series</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong>View past week&#8217;s questions here: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola/monday-march-17-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">March 17, 2025</a></strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola#Past_Articles" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">See our full list of past articles here</a></strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Click here</a> to submit a question</strong> </div></div></div></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola/monday-march-24-2025">Ask Dr. Paola: Monday March 24, 2025</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dogedit">Dogster Team</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

From tiny to large, cancerous to benign, all dogs will invariably end up with one lump or many over the course of their life. The tricky part is knowing which ones to worry about. The frustrating answer is that in most cases, without at least having a vet take a look or a proper examination of cells under the microscope, it is often impossible to say for sure which lumps need to be dealt with urgently, and which ones are suitable for a ‘wait and see’ approach.</p>\n<p>The other day, I was quite startled to see an enormous furry lump protruding from Kodah’s derriere. Fortunately, in this particular instance, I didn’t need to perform any tests to determine the nature of the lump, because that lump is a Chihuahua called Ned.</p>\n<h2>Who Are You Calling A Lump?</h2>\n<figure id="attachment_763046" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-763046" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-763046 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Should-I-Be-Worried-About-This-Lump_Dr-Karyn-800x510.jpg" alt="Should I Be Worried About This Lump?" width="800" height="510" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Should-I-Be-Worried-About-This-Lump_Dr-Karyn-800x510.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Should-I-Be-Worried-About-This-Lump_Dr-Karyn-600x383.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Should-I-Be-Worried-About-This-Lump_Dr-Karyn-768x490.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Should-I-Be-Worried-About-This-Lump_Dr-Karyn-250x159.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Should-I-Be-Worried-About-This-Lump_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-763046" class="wp-caption-text">Should I Be Worried About This Lump?</figcaption></figure>\n<p>One of my favorite things about my <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/are-dogs-pack-animals" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">little dog pack</a> is the way the tiniest member has positioned himself – both literally and figuratively – at the top of the heap. There is nothing quite like watching an 80-lb Malinois Shepherd being put in his place by a 4-lb Chihuahua, without even a hint of resistance. After all, in canine society, it&#8217;s not the size of your body that matters, but the size of your ego, and Ned has plenty to go around!</p>\n<h2>A Confused Lump</h2>\n<figure id="attachment_715381" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-715381" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-715381 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kodah-makes-the-best-pillow-according-to-Ned._Dr-Karyn-800x543.jpg" alt="Kodah makes the best pillow according to Ned." width="800" height="543" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kodah-makes-the-best-pillow-according-to-Ned._Dr-Karyn-800x543.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kodah-makes-the-best-pillow-according-to-Ned._Dr-Karyn-600x408.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kodah-makes-the-best-pillow-according-to-Ned._Dr-Karyn-768x522.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kodah-makes-the-best-pillow-according-to-Ned._Dr-Karyn-250x170.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kodah-makes-the-best-pillow-according-to-Ned._Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-715381" class="wp-caption-text">Kodah makes the best pillow according to Ned.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>What’s interesting about <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/whos-the-boss-debunking-the-dominance-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">the dynamics of our dog family</a> is how they seem to shift and change, usually depending largely on Ned’s mood. One minute he’s launching himself across the room, yelling at Kodah for having the audacity to glance at this food bowl, the next minute he’s literally curled up under his tail; talk about feeling secure in your position! What is most consistent in this dynamic is that Kodah seems to be equally happy when being told off, stood on, or snuggled up to; he is just thrilled to be included in whichever capacity Ned, and his trusty offsider, Fred, sees fit.</p>\n<h2>The Lump Keeps Coming Back</h2>\n<figure id="attachment_763048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-763048" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-763048 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Who-called-Ned-a-lump_Dr-Karyn-800x545.jpg" alt="Who called Ned a lump?!" width="800" height="545" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Who-called-Ned-a-lump_Dr-Karyn-800x545.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Who-called-Ned-a-lump_Dr-Karyn-600x409.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Who-called-Ned-a-lump_Dr-Karyn-768x524.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Who-called-Ned-a-lump_Dr-Karyn-250x170.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Who-called-Ned-a-lump_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-763048" class="wp-caption-text">Who called Ned a lump?!</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Despite Ned’s short fuse when it comes to Kodah, no matter how many times he detaches himself, he is a lump that just keeps coming back. When all the noise and posturing have finished and the games are at an end, Ned loves to curl up against or on top of Kodah. The relationship between these dogs, little and large, is comparable to that of brothers, always fighting and making up, only to start all over again. And although Kodah is older by more than 12 months, not to mention heavier by more than 70 lbs, his role seems to be very much the one of ‘little brother,’ desperate for approval, just wanting to be part of the game. And if that means playing host to a benign little Ned-shaped lump, he’s only too happy to oblige.</p>\n<p>The thing I find most comforting is knowing that the only way Kodah would ever harm his tiny friends is accidentally, and it seems that Ned knows it, too. This is one lump that neither Kodah or I are worried about, which is lucky because it is a lump that is not going away!</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-676104" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Karyn-paw-signature.jpg" alt="Dr. Karyn paw signature" width="1194" height="290" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Karyn-paw-signature.jpg.webp 1194w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Karyn-paw-signature-600x146.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Karyn-paw-signature-768x187.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Karyn-paw-signature-250x61.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1194px) 100vw, 1194px" /></p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#00285e;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#1E5B91;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article is a part of Dr. Karyn's series with her five dogs.</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#FAA41A"></i> <strong>Read her previous article: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/jumping-chihuahuas-neds-loophole" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Jumping Chihuahuas: Ned Finds a Loophole</a><br />\n</strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#FAA41A"></i> <strong>Read her next article: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/chihuahua-abscesses-neds-bummer-of-a-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Dealing with Chihuahua Abscesses: Ned’s Bummer of a Week</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/kodahs-enormous-furry-lump">Kodah&#8217;s Enormous Furry Lump: Should Dr. Karyn Be Worried?</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-karyn-kanowski">Dr. Karyn Kanowski, BVSc MRCVS (Vet)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

which is why it is crucial to choose the right shampoo. Our pups rely on us to provide proper care, so you need to ensure that the shampoo you select suits your dog’s needs.</p>\n<p>You probably already have dog shampoo at home if you are a dog parent. But now the question is: &#8220;Does dog shampoo expire?&#8221;<b> Dog shampoo lasts a long time, but it does have an expiration or best-before day.</b></p>\n<p>Dogs don’t require frequent baths, and many of us forget when we bought the shampoo or want to use the whole bottle before throwing it away. However, that can cause problems.

Most commercial products have a time frame indicated in months, which means that manufacturers recommend using the product within that period once it’s been opened. Be sure to keep the lid closed, as oxygen will accelerate the changes in the composition of the chemicals in the shampoo. After being opened, most dog shampoos last only 12–18 months. Of course, the expiration dates vary, so we strongly suggest always checking the bottle.</p>\n<p>Regular dog shampoos tend to last longer, commonly up to 36 months, while medical shampoos, such as the ones for fleas, may have shorter lifespans. These have stronger chemicals and require you to be extra careful with the storage, though some products can have longer shelf lives if they’re properly stored. Typically, each shampoo bottle will have a lot number and expiration date.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_571619" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-571619" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-571619" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groomer-washing-a-welsh-corgi-dog-in-bath_BONDART-PHOTOGRAPH_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="groomer washing a welsh corgi dog in bath" width="800" height="505" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groomer-washing-a-welsh-corgi-dog-in-bath_BONDART-PHOTOGRAPH_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groomer-washing-a-welsh-corgi-dog-in-bath_BONDART-PHOTOGRAPH_Shutterstock-600x379.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groomer-washing-a-welsh-corgi-dog-in-bath_BONDART-PHOTOGRAPH_Shutterstock-768x485.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/groomer-washing-a-welsh-corgi-dog-in-bath_BONDART-PHOTOGRAPH_Shutterstock-250x158.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-571619" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: BONDART PHOTOGRAPHY, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Can You Continue Using Expired Dog Shampoo?</h3>\n<p>The expiration date is on the bottle for a reason, so using it after it expires could lead to various issues, from the product not cleaning as effectively to causing irritated, dry, itchy skin. It might be okay to use a few days after the expiration date, but it could also cause skin irritation and even an infection.</p>\n<p>Basically, using expired dog shampoo is not worth the risk, so it’s best to follow the guidelines on the bottle. Do not buy expired shampoos, and throw out the bottle you have at home once the expiration date passes.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716647" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-scaled.webp" alt="divider single dog paw oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-2-2024_6-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Where Do You Find the Expiration Date?</h2>\n<p>The location of the expiration date is different on each shampoo, though it’s commonly on the side, bottom, or back of the bottle. The expiration date should be easily visible so you and any other dog owner know how long it will last.</p>\n<h3>If There&#8217;s No Expiration Date on the Shampoo Bottle</h3>\n<p>If you encounter a shampoo you would like to purchase for your pup but it doesn’t have an expiration date, you can do a few things to find more information about it. Try to reach the manufacturer for more details, so either check out the website or call the customer service line.

There’s a reason that there are canine and human shampoos. The chemicals that human shampoos contain are more acidic and not dog-appropriate. Our furry friends have different pH levels, and human shampoo can damage their skin.</p>\n<p>If you use human shampoo on your pup, it will likely cause redness, skin irritation, and possible infections. Our dogs need products that will moisturize their skin and give it the necessary care.</p>\n<p>If you need guidance on finding the correct products for your dog&#8217;s grooming needs, we suggest you speak to a vet.</p>\n<p>Did you know you can talk to a vet online?

It’s so cute! With Chihuahuas in the house, I would have expected that my velcro dog would be of the tiny variety, and <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/ned-the-helpless" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Ned is certainly pretty firmly attached</a> to me. However, if the choice is between me and some food, I’m afraid I come a close second. I was also surprised when reading up on <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/velcro-dog-breeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">classic velcro dog breeds</a> that German Shepherds made the list, but I shouldn’t have been, because I now realize that Kodah, my Shepherd x Malinois, is 100% my velcro dog.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764683" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-764683 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Keeping-me-company-when-Im-working-outside-while-Ned-Fred-play_Dr-Karyn-800x593.jpg" alt="Keeping me company when I'm working outside while Ned &amp; Fred play" width="800" height="593" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Keeping-me-company-when-Im-working-outside-while-Ned-Fred-play_Dr-Karyn-800x593.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Keeping-me-company-when-Im-working-outside-while-Ned-Fred-play_Dr-Karyn-600x445.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Keeping-me-company-when-Im-working-outside-while-Ned-Fred-play_Dr-Karyn-768x569.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Keeping-me-company-when-Im-working-outside-while-Ned-Fred-play_Dr-Karyn-250x185.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Keeping-me-company-when-Im-working-outside-while-Ned-Fred-play_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764683" class="wp-caption-text">Keeping me company when I&#8217;m working outside while Ned &amp; Fred play</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Kodah’s Favorite Things</h2>\n<p>Like most dogs, Kodah’s needs are relatively few, and it doesn’t take much to make him happy. His favorite things include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Me</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/kodah-addicted-to-the-hose" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">The hose</a></li>\n<li>His ball</li>\n<li>Food</li>\n<li>Husband</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/ned-and-fred-eating-sleeping-up-to-something" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Ned &amp; Fred</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The irony? I was dead against getting him. When we lost our gentle giant, Remus the Irish Wolfhound, we were left with a very sensible number of dogs: three; Poppy &amp; Bailey the Labradors, and our rescue Chihuahua, Potato (Tate). However, Husband insisted that we needed a fourth, wearing me down until Kodah joined the family. Of course, I was right, and he has proven to be very hard work, particularly as his Malinois genes weren’t disclosed when we first brought him home! Also unsurprisingly, I have ended up with most of that work! Whilst Husband took on the role of primary disciplinarian and male leader, as the female leader of <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/are-dogs-pack-animals" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">our pack</a>, I have the distinct privilege of having something of a maternal place in his life, and Kodah is definitely a ‘momma’s boy’!</p>\n<h2>My Shadow</h2>\n<figure id="attachment_764684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764684" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-764684 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Never-far-behind-me_Dr-Karyn-800x616.jpg" alt="Never far behind me" width="800" height="616" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Never-far-behind-me_Dr-Karyn-800x616.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Never-far-behind-me_Dr-Karyn-600x462.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Never-far-behind-me_Dr-Karyn-768x591.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Never-far-behind-me_Dr-Karyn-250x193.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Never-far-behind-me_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764684" class="wp-caption-text">Never far behind me</figcaption></figure>\n<p>No one likes to be alone, and in my house, you never are. Closed doors are met with confusion and consternation, and even bathroom visits are not sacrosanct. We’ve learned that if we need to keep the pets away, firmly latched doors and snacks are required, and most of the time, it’s easier to accept the company.</p>\n<p>My office doubles as our ‘cat room,’ with a child gate to keep the dogs out, giving our felines somewhere to relax without fear of canine interference, and to keep Kodah from <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/why-do-dogs-eat-cat-poop" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">sampling items from the litter box</a>. However, during the day, the cats prefer to luxuriate in our bedroom as it gets the morning sun, and the wardrobe is apparently far superior to the feline furnishings I have kitted out their room with. As a result, Kodah has taken to joining me in the office/cat sanctuary, positioning himself under my desk (good) or behind the wheels of my chair (not so good).</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764685" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764685" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-764685 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Catching-some-zzz-under-my-desk_Dr-Karyn-800x603.jpg" alt="Catching some zzz under my desk" width="800" height="603" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Catching-some-zzz-under-my-desk_Dr-Karyn-800x603.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Catching-some-zzz-under-my-desk_Dr-Karyn-600x452.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Catching-some-zzz-under-my-desk_Dr-Karyn-768x579.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Catching-some-zzz-under-my-desk_Dr-Karyn-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Catching-some-zzz-under-my-desk_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764685" class="wp-caption-text">Catching some zzz under my desk</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Permanently Stuck in the ‘On’ Position</h2>\n<p>Even when we’re relaxing in front of the TV or on the bed reading a book, if I so much as move an inch, Kodah is up and ready to go wherever I might be headed. Sometimes it’s to the kitchen, sometimes the bathroom, and sometimes I’m just scratching an itch! The combination of velcro dog and g<a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/guard-dog-in-disguise-a-tale-of-defense" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">uard dog instincts</a> means that he is rarely in full relaxation mode, which explains why he sleeps quite soundly through the night!</p>\n<p>Fortunately, while Kodah prefers to stay within licking distance of me, he’s not overprotective and doesn’t stop people or other dogs from approaching. In fact, I wouldn’t even call him protective! Despite his fearsome appearance, he is far more likely to hide behind me in the event of an attack than come to my rescue! Although he’s the first to bark wildly at any person, animal, or leaf passing the window, the few times we have heard an actual ‘worrying’ sound from outside, like when the neighbor’s teenage son was locked out of the house, or the rubbish bins blew over, he has literally wedged himself between me and the back of the sofa. So brave.</p>\n<p>Luckily for me, my velcro dog and I have a Ned to protect us!</p>\n<figure id="attachment_764686" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764686" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-764686 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kodah-with-his-security-detail-Ned_Dr-Karyn-800x543.jpg" alt="Kodah with his security detail, Ned" width="800" height="543" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kodah-with-his-security-detail-Ned_Dr-Karyn-800x543.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kodah-with-his-security-detail-Ned_Dr-Karyn-600x408.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kodah-with-his-security-detail-Ned_Dr-Karyn-768x522.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kodah-with-his-security-detail-Ned_Dr-Karyn-250x170.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kodah-with-his-security-detail-Ned_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764686" class="wp-caption-text">Kodah with his security detail, Ned</figcaption></figure>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-676104" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Karyn-paw-signature.jpg" alt="Dr. Karyn paw signature" width="1194" height="290" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Karyn-paw-signature.jpg.webp 1194w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Karyn-paw-signature-600x146.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Karyn-paw-signature-768x187.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr.-Karyn-paw-signature-250x61.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1194px) 100vw, 1194px" /></p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#00285e;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#1E5B91;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article is a part of Dr. Karyn's series with her five dogs.</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#FAA41A"></i> <strong>Read her previous article: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/nail-clipping-ned-the-piranha" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Nail Clipping Piranha Dogs: Ned Tries the Hanging Bag Method</a><br />\n</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/velcro-dog-experience-kodah">The Velcro Dog Experience: Life with Kodah the Shadow</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-karyn-kanowski">Dr. Karyn Kanowski, BVSc MRCVS (Vet)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

Over the last few months, when we went for walks, she was off the lead and followed me and the other two dogs (and cat) like a puppy. But in the last week, she has found her adventurous spirit and seems like she’s decided to get better acquainted with the surrounding fields and forest.</p>\n<h2>GPS Location For Peace of Mind</h2>\n<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764804" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GPS-collar-app-tracker_Dr-Maja.jpg" alt="GPS collar app tracker" width="415" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GPS-collar-app-tracker_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 830w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GPS-collar-app-tracker_Dr-Maja-415x600.jpg.webp 415w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GPS-collar-app-tracker_Dr-Maja-692x1000.jpg.webp 692w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GPS-collar-app-tracker_Dr-Maja-768x1110.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GPS-collar-app-tracker_Dr-Maja-250x361.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GPS-collar-app-tracker_Dr-Maja-600x867.jpg.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></p>\n<p>All of my pets <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/can-dogs-ever-be-trusted" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">wear a GPS collar</a>, as I am too anxious about them getting lost. Lajka is no exception. In the three months of living with us, she’s already managed to lose one GPS collar that I needed to replace. She is a peculiar character. Initially, she would run back to the house while we were out on a walk if she heard a car in the distance. She stays close to the house and has a radius of around 1000 feet. Initially, this worried me a lot, as I am used to my dogs being on a lead or inside, never unsupervised outside. But Lajka is a different story. As I rescued her, I decided, within reason, to give her the freedom she is used to. And that means she is free to go as she pleases, as luckily, we live very remotely and far from any roads or other houses. Having the GPS on her allows me to track her movements and see what she’s up to. And thanks to that, I was able to see how far from the house she stayed for hours on end last week.</p>\n<h2>Three Hours Later</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764805 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-looking-up_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg" alt="Lajka looking up" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-looking-up_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-looking-up_Dr-Maja-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-looking-up_Dr-Maja-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-looking-up_Dr-Maja-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-looking-up_Dr-Maja-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-looking-up_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>One day last week, during our regular walks, Lajka behaved as usual. She would run around but follow me and the gang closely. Then she slowly started to go farther and farther away, still keeping an eye on us. Being a hunting dog, she has a great nose and an even greater <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/how-to-stop-your-dog-from-digging" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">desire to dig holes</a>, to the point of literally digging one hole for a few hours on end. I couldn’t believe it. She would stay in the fields and refuse to follow us back home. This is all just over a mile from the house. The first few times, I just carried her a bit of the way home, and that worked. But one day I decided to see what would happen if I left her to her hole.</p>\n<p>Well, she stayed in the same spot for over 3 hours, digging her hole. She finally came back home around midday, well after breakfast time. But she was so happy and proud of herself, and covered in dirt, from head to toe. And most importantly, she knew very well where her home and safety were.</p>\n<h2>Learning to Cope with Anxiety</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-764806 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-and-Hela-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg" alt="Lava and Hela in the field" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-and-Hela-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-and-Hela-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-and-Hela-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-and-Hela-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-and-Hela-in-the-field_Dr-Maja-500x375.jpg.webp 500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-and-Hela-in-the-field_Dr-Maja.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>For me, this was a big step, allowing the dog to do her own thing and not interfering. My other dog, Lava, loves to run off to my neighbour’s house, and I always follow after her to get her home straightaway, although no harm comes of it, and again, there are no real dangers. She just plays with the neighbour’s dogs and comes home when she gets tired. But it still makes me anxious, not having her close by. Although Lajka has only been with me for a few months, I already love this little dog a lot and couldn’t imagine anything bad happening to her. But I am also learning to let go and relax. After all, I don’t live in the city, but there are different threats there, such as wild animals. But I realised so far that my dogs do have a<a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/are-dogs-smarter-than-wolves" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank"> strong survival instinct</a> and intelligence to know how to behave in most situations. I am slowly learning to let go a little bit so they can enjoy a bit more of their freedom, as we live in such a peaceful place, and it would be a shame to restrict them too much. But it’s a new experience for me, and I know it will take much more time for me to get used to it, if ever, but I will do my best.</p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#00285e;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#1E5B91;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article is a part of Dr. Maja, Lava and Hela's series.</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#FAA41A"></i> <strong>Read her previous article: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/feeding-frenzy-lava-hela-lajka" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Feeding Frenzy: Lava, Hela &amp; Lajka’s Mealtimes</a><br />\n</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/adventure-dogs-lajkas-explorations">Adventure Dogs: Lajka&#8217;s Explorations</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-maja-platisa">Dr. Maja Platisa DVM MRCVS (Veterinarian)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

My Dog Has a Sore Behind His Ear</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Dear Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Teddy is around 10 years old. He was a drop off when I found him, I thought he was dying! He had sores that drained puss all over his body. I worked on him all the time and he is finally getting his hair back now, but he has a sore behind his ear that&#8217;s as big as half his head. I had been in the hospital for two months, and when I got home, he was missing. He was gone for six weeks; thankfully, I found him in my front yard. We need help. He is a fighter. He loves to go outside and sit in the sun and has a big heart. Can someone help us? We need you! Thank you,” </strong>&#8211; Teddy &amp; Karen</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Karen,</p>\n<p>Thank you for sharing Teddy’s journey. It’s incredibly moving, and it’s clear how much love and dedication you’ve poured into his care. The way you brought him back from such a fragile state speaks volumes about your compassion and determination. It’s heartbreaking to hear that after all he’s been through, he’s now dealing with another serious sore, especially one as large as you described behind his ear. Given the size and location, this could be a severe infection, an <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/how-to-treat-an-abscess-on-a-dog-at-home" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">abscess</a>, or something more complex like a growth or immune-mediated condition, particularly in an older dog with a history of <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/common-skin-issues-in-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">skin issues</a>.</p>\n<p>Teddy’s strength and spirit are admirable. But at this stage, it’s important he’s seen by a veterinarian in person as soon as possible. He may need specific treatment like wound care, antibiotics, or diagnostics to understand what’s going on beneath the surface.

My Dogs Has an Enlarged Heart!</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span style="font-size: 17.6px;">&#8220;</span>My Yorkie, Katie, is 5.5 lbs and 12.5 years old. Recently diagnosed with enlarged heart by cardiologist. No prescriptions were given, but we were told she should have ‘no salt in her diet.’ I plan on using Dogster’s recipe for ground beef and vegetables mixed with a little bit of Dr. Marty Nature Blend because she loves Dr Marty&#8217;s food, and it keeps her regular, gives her bright eyes, low weight and energy. She’s been on Dr Marty&#8217;s her whole life. I called Dr Marty&#8217;s business and spoke with a knowledgeable person who said salt is the last item on the ingredient list, and there is very minimal salt (0.02). The vet said to use canned dog food.</strong><strong style="font-size: 17.6px;">&#8220;</strong><span style="font-size: 17.6px;"> &#8211; Agnes</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Agnes, thank you for sharing those details about Katie. At 12.5 years old, it&#8217;s clear you&#8217;re deeply committed to making thoughtful choices for her, especially now with her recent diagnosis of an enlarged heart. While no medication was prescribed, managing her sodium intake is indeed crucial for some dog’s heart health, especially if the veterinary cardiologist recommends it.</p>\n<p>Katie has done well on <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/dr-marty-natures-blend-dog-food-review" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Dr. Marty’s food</a> for years, and since it supports her digestion, energy levels, and healthy weight, it’s understandable why you’d want to keep it as part of her routine. However, even if salt is listed last on the ingredient list and the representative mentioned it’s around 0.02, it’s still important to clarify whether that figure represents 0.02% of the total food (as fed) or of the dry matter. Because sodium levels aren’t always published on pet food packaging, I recommend emailing the company directly to request the exact total sodium content (in mg per 100 kcal or as a percentage on a dry matter basis). Once you have that information, bring it back to your veterinarian. This allows them to assess whether Dr. Marty’s food fits within the recommended sodium range for dogs with cardiac changes, which is often less than 100 mg per 100 kcal for a <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/best-low-sodium-dog-foods" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">low-sodium diet</a>.</p>\n<p>Many veterinarians are most familiar with specific therapeutic diets and may feel hesitant to endorse alternatives outside of those brands, especially without guaranteed nutrient profiles. However, with a bit of extra effort and transparency from the brand, it’s absolutely possible to make well-informed, tailored decisions. <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/are-homemade-dog-food-recipes-right-for-your-dog" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Homemade meals</a> such as the beef and vegetable blend you&#8217;re planning can be an excellent base, but since she has a medical condition, they must be formulated specially for her particular case by a veterinary nutritionist and approved by her cardiologist first. Then, combining it with a food Katie already loves could help maintain her appetite and overall well-being.</p>\n<p>Wishing her good health,</p>\n<p>Dr. Paola</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716646" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 2 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h3>Help! My Dog Might Be HIV Positive!</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Hi Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If a mother dog is said to possibly be HIV positive and she delivers puppies, does the blood cross to the puppies? Will they have it?&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Betty Joe</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Betty Joe,<br />\nThank you for your question. First and foremost, <em>dogs cannot contract or carry HIV</em> (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). HIV is specific to humans and doesn’t infect dogs or any other non-human species. So even if someone has said a mother dog is &#8220;possibly HIV positive,&#8221; this is likely a misunderstanding—either a mix-up in terminology or confusion with a different condition.</p>\n<p>To clarify further, the types of viruses that can cause immune system issues in dogs are completely different from HIV. For example, dogs can contract <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/distemper-in-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">canine distemper virus</a> or <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/parvo-in-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">canine parvovirus</a>, but these are species-specific and have no connection to HIV. In terms of maternal blood crossing to puppies, it&#8217;s true that some viral infections from the mother like herpes virus, canine parvovirus-1, and distemper (though rarely), can pass through the placenta and infect fetuses, leading to embryonic death, abortion, or neonatal illness depending on the stage of gestation when the mother gets sick. It is also possible that if the mother dog had a transmissible condition, the disease could also be passed through <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/how-long-should-puppy-be-nursed-by-mother" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">nursing</a> or close contact after birth, not just through shared blood.</p>\n<p>In this case, there’s no risk of puppies acquiring HIV from their mother because dogs simply don’t get HIV. If there&#8217;s concern about the mother’s health or exposure to any disease affecting dogs, a veterinarian can run appropriate tests to ensure the puppies get the best start in life.</p>\n<p>I hope this information is helpful to you.</p>\n<p>Dr. Paola</p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#004288;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#2575bb;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article is a part of our weekly Ask Dr. Paola series</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong>View past week&#8217;s questions here: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola/monday-april-7-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">April 7, 2025</a></strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola#Past_Articles" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">See our full list of past articles here</a></strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Click here</a> to submit a question</strong> </div></div></div></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola/monday-april-14-2025">Ask Dr. Paola: Monday April 14, 2025</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-paola-cuevas">Dr. Paola Cuevas MVZ (Vet)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

Tanzania is also home to approximately 3 million stray dogs.</p>\n<p>In a country where poverty and public health have been the focus of many missions and charitable organizations, one man saw a need to address the way stray animal populations impacted, and were impacted by, these issues. In 2021, Alpha Maiseli founded <a href="https://www.animalsmileafrica.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Animal Smile Africa</a>, an NGO located in the nation’s capital of Dodoma, with a vision of improving the lives of animals in need, under the guiding values of <strong>compassion, sustainability, </strong>and <strong>integrity.</strong></p>\n<p>With the help and support of his former colleagues at Visele Livecrop Skills Training Centre and the founder of International Veterinary Outreach, Alpha has created an organization that is helping to improve the health of stray dogs and cats, as well as providing education and experience that benefit the whole community.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Malaika’s Story</h2>\n<figure id="attachment_764816" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-764816" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-764816 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ngimba-with-Malaika_Alpha-Maiseli-Animal-Smile-Africa-800x533.jpg" alt="Ngimba with Malaika" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ngimba-with-Malaika_Alpha-Maiseli-Animal-Smile-Africa-800x533.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ngimba-with-Malaika_Alpha-Maiseli-Animal-Smile-Africa-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ngimba-with-Malaika_Alpha-Maiseli-Animal-Smile-Africa-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ngimba-with-Malaika_Alpha-Maiseli-Animal-Smile-Africa-250x167.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ngimba-with-Malaika_Alpha-Maiseli-Animal-Smile-Africa.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-764816" class="wp-caption-text">Ngimba with Malaika (Image Credit: Alpha Maiseli, Animal Smile Africa)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Malaika was brought to Animal Smile Africa by her young owner, Ngimba, who was worried about her future and health.

By offering training and experience opportunities, he hopes to increase awareness and understanding of animal health and welfare and improve the relationship and bond between humans and animals, all while reducing the number of stray cats and dogs, zoonotic parasites, and the incidence of rabies.</p>\n<p>Currently, around 1500 people die each year from rabies infection in Tanzania, and the more <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/how-often-do-dogs-need-rabies-shots" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">animals that are vaccinated against this fatal virus</a>, the lower that figure becomes.

However, the other ingredients are not. While potatoes are included as the second ingredient, they likely should be far higher, as there are many types of potatoes in these treats.

On top of the treats not upsetting your pet’s stomach, they may help your pooch eat other foods too—green-lipped mussels are particularly good at strengthening your dog’s digestive system.</p>\n<p>Plus, these ingredients also include plenty of protein, omega fatty acids, glucosamine, and chondroitin.

Plus, this recipe also doesn’t contain any corn, wheat, or soy.</p>\n<p>The main draw of these treats is that they mostly contain just beef.

However, if your dog has a sensitive stomach, you’ll need to be extremely careful about <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/farm-hounds-natural-chews-treats-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">the treat you decide to purchase</a> for them. After all, not only do you want something healthy, but you also want something that isn’t going to upset their stomach.</p>\n<p>Honestly, the only way to figure out if a treat is going to upset your dog’s stomach or not is to have them try it. While you may be able to narrow it down to certain key ingredients that your dog’s stomach doesn’t like, there will always be treats that seem to set them off for no apparent reason.</p>\n<p>However, you can still choose treats as carefully as possible to help avoid a reaction—hopefully. When you’re looking for dog treats for sensitive dogs, the first thing you should check is the ingredient list. Here is what you should look for.</p>\n<h2>Single Sourced Animal Proteins</h2>\n<p>Many dogs are allergic to a particular kind of animal protein, while others only have issues when proteins are mixed together. A dog’s stomach may have problems digesting more than one type of protein at a time.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we only recommend choosing foods that have one type of protein if at all possible. It may go a long way toward reducing your dog’s digestion problems.</p>\n<p>You may even want to match this protein with the food that they are eating. For instance, if your dog is currently eating lamb food and doing fine on it, consider looking for lamb treats as well.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_103420" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103420" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-103420" src="https://dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/austraian-shepherd-dog-having-treat_Christian-Mueller-Shutterstock.jpg" alt="austraian shepherd dog having treat" width="810" height="540" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-103420" class="wp-caption-text">Image By: Christian Mueller, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Easily Digestible Carbs (or None at All)</h2>\n<p>Preferably, you should choose treats that don’t have any added carbohydrates. Freeze-dried meat is a good option, for instance. However, many treats need a starch of some sort to help hold everything together.</p>\n<p>Therefore, you should look for a highly digestible carb, like potatoes.</p>\n<p>However, you don’t want <em>too </em>many potatoes, peas, or similar veggies. When fed in high amounts, these foods have been linked with <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/outbreaks-and-advisories/fda-investigation-potential-link-between-certain-diets-and-canine-dilated-cardiomyopathy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">heart problems</a>. Therefore, your best bet is to choose an option that is low in these starches, if it includes them at all.</p>\n<h2>Animal-Based Fats</h2>\n<p>When at all possible, we recommend choosing treats that have added <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/common-fat-sources-in-dog-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">animal fats</a>. If the treat uses whole meat, they may not necessarily need any animal fat. However, if added fat is included, you should check to ensure that it is from an animal source, such as salmon oil or chicken fat.</p>\n<p>These fats make the food taste good, and they’re easier for your dog to digest than plant-based fats. Plus, they include the omega 3s that your dog needs to remain healthy.</p>\n<h2>Fiber</h2>\n<p>Fiber is a boon to <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/best-dog-food-for-digestive-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">the digestive system</a>. Most dogs with sensitive digestion could do with more fiber in their diet to help calm their stomachs. For this reason, we recommend looking for treats that have extra fiber in them.</p>\n<p>However, don’t choose treats with low-quality ingredients just because they have fiber—you’re looking for treats that are healthy and fiber-rich.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_35142" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35142" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35142" src="https://dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/person-giving-dog-a-treat-e1621963777919.jpeg" alt="giving dog a treat" width="810" height="540" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35142" class="wp-caption-text">Image By: Omerlavon, Pixabay</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>No Artificial Ingredients</h2>\n<p>Preferably, you should avoid artificial ingredients, like colors and flavors. In many cases, these artificial ingredients are not needed in the least. Your dog does not care about what their food looks like. And, if the food needs added flavor, then it isn’t using high-quality ingredients to begin with.</p>\n<p>Plus, many of these ingredients can have a negative impact on our dogs, especially if they are already having a problem with their digestion. Therefore, look for treats that are all-natural and don’t contain any of these ingredients. Otherwise, your pet may have a hard time digesting them.</p>\n<h2>Probiotics</h2>\n<p>Probiotics are a great option for dogs with digestion problems. Often, it is recommended that these dogs take some sort of probiotic supplement, anyway. However, you cannot overdose on probiotics, so adding a probiotic treat likely couldn’t hurt.</p>\n<p>Luckily, it isn’t terribly difficult to find treats with probiotics. In many cases, quality treats designed for digestion will include them.</p>\n<p>If you need veterinary advice over your dog&#8217;s nutrition, we recommend speaking with a vet.</p>\n<p><span data-sheets-root="1"><p><div class="su-box su-box-style-default pangovet-mention-box" id="" style="border-color:#003e92;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#0971c5;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">💛 🐶 Speak To a Vet Online From the Comfort of Your Couch!</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3542157 chewy-in-content-image" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PangoVet_Mention-in-Content_v10_Oct-18-2024-copy.png" alt="PangoVet" width="375" /></p>\r\n<p style="font-weight: 500; text-align: center; line-height: 1.5; font-size: medium !important; margin-bottom: 20px;">If you need to speak with a vet but can&#8217;t get to one, head over to <a href="https://pangovet.com?utm_source=dogster&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=dog-nutrition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><b>PangoVet</b></a>.

However, there are lots of ingredients you should consider looking for too.</p>\n<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-nutrition/best-canned-pumpkin-for-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">pumpkin</a> has long been said to improve the digestive health of dogs. Therefore, you may want to consider finding a pumpkin treat to feed to your canine. (However, there is no scientific research on the actual efficacy of pumpkin in improving digestive health, so your mileage may vary heavily.)</p>\n<p>There are lots of other ingredients that are said to help digestion too. Usually, you’ll find these added ingredients in foods that are specifically designed for digestion.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_45939" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45939" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-45939" src="https://dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sweet-Potato-Dog-Treats-Recipe.jpg" alt="Sweet-Potato-Dog-Treats-Recipe" width="800" height="531" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-45939" class="wp-caption-text">Image By: pakornkrit, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Our Selection Process For Treats for Dogs With Sensitive Stomachs</h2>\n<p>To create this buyer&#8217;s guide, our writing team and editorial staff checked customer reviews, brand reputation, and veterinary approval ratings to present the dog treats we think should be highlighted for our readers.

Every Wednesday, we share a story from one of our Dogsters. This week is about Kate &amp; Gizmo, her scruffy Pug mix.</strong></p>\n<p>What happens when you bring a small-town dog to the big city? Gizmo and I recently found out!</p>\n<p>Gizmo started life somewhere in Texas, but he spent his formative early adult years in a smaller city in Colorado. I could tell pretty early on, though, that he was better suited to something a little more urban…</p>\n<h2>Gizmo in the Neighborhood</h2>\n<figure id="attachment_765094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-765094" style="width: 807px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-765094" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Neighborhood-park-Nah_Kate-and-Giz.jpeg" alt="Neighborhood park?

This would be the dream for many dogs, but for some reason, Gizmo seemed to feel on duty in the sparsely populated (but very safe) streets. He was constantly on the lookout for people and dogs to bark at.</p>\n<p>When we exited the neighborhood and walked down Main Street, though, he was immediately at ease, gamely trotting up to greet everyone sitting at tables along the sidewalk and walking by, peering into every shop doorway, and sitting calmly while we waited for the lights to change. It was mysterious: the busy hum and chaos of cars going by and people chatting was apparently much more relaxing than the quiet calm of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>We did work with a trainer and got the barking under control with<a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/how-to-clicker-train-a-dog" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank"> clicker training</a>, but this method required me to remain ever-vigilant while out on a walk so I could head off any sudden barking fits with a quick click-and-treat. Not very relaxing for either of us!</p>\n<h2>Ready for a (Much) Bigger Pond</h2>\n<p>When it came time for a big cross-country move to San Francisco, I was a little nervous about how Gizmo would cope. Going from a chill town to a major city is a lot for any dog to handle, and I adopted Giz as an adult rescue, so who knows what he’d already seen in his first year or so of life. But one thing that made me feel a whole lot more confident was Gizmo’s already visibly city-friendly attitude: I realized he might actually be better behaved living in an apartment in a city! He’s also a small dog (18 pounds), so he’s allowed in many buildings that would otherwise not be pet-friendly.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_765089" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-765089" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-765089" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-King-of-the-Moving-Van_Kate.jpeg" alt="Gizmo, King of the Moving Van" width="450" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-King-of-the-Moving-Van_Kate.jpeg.webp 1050w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-King-of-the-Moving-Van_Kate-450x600.jpeg.webp 450w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-King-of-the-Moving-Van_Kate-750x1000.jpeg.webp 750w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-King-of-the-Moving-Van_Kate-768x1024.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-King-of-the-Moving-Van_Kate-250x333.jpeg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-King-of-the-Moving-Van_Kate-300x400.jpeg.webp 300w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-King-of-the-Moving-Van_Kate-600x800.jpeg.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-765089" class="wp-caption-text">Gizmo, King of the Moving Van</figcaption></figure>\n<p>We packed everything into a moving van and headed West. On the many-hour drive, Gizmo rode like a king in the middle seat of the van, watching the states go by. On arrival in the city, he was big-eyed and a little unsure. But once he <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/favorite-sleeping-spots-the-wednesday-dogs-of-dogster" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">spotted his beloved yellow couch</a> and confirmed that his required one-dog-bed-per-room minimum had been satisfied, he settled right in.</p>\n<h2>Supersizing Our Walks</h2>\n<p>Gizmo was used to daily neighborhood walks, but they got a whole lot longer (and steeper!) as soon as we got to San Francisco. He is a very sporty little guy with legs for days, relative to his overall size. And with the many <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-friendly-activities-san-francisco" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">dog-friendly patios, piers, and parks</a>, there’s always somewhere to take a rest.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765095" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trio-of-Gizmo-exploring-SF_Kate.png" alt="Trio of Gizmo exploring SF" width="1754" height="802" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trio-of-Gizmo-exploring-SF_Kate.png.webp 1754w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trio-of-Gizmo-exploring-SF_Kate-600x274.png.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trio-of-Gizmo-exploring-SF_Kate-800x366.png.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trio-of-Gizmo-exploring-SF_Kate-768x351.png.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trio-of-Gizmo-exploring-SF_Kate-1536x702.png.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trio-of-Gizmo-exploring-SF_Kate-250x114.png.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1754px) 100vw, 1754px" /></p>\n<p>One of the best things about making such a big move has been the opportunity to reset some bad habits. I’m trying to be a lot more serious about barking (more important now that it’s not just my eardrums being assaulted), and I don’t carry the clicker anymore. He picked up immediately that I didn’t want him barking at anyone on the streets, which I don’t think he fully understood before. There’s plenty left to work on, but it feels amazing making such sudden progress!</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765096" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Second-set-of-Giz-exploring-SF_Kate.png" alt="Second set of Giz exploring SF" width="1922" height="796" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Second-set-of-Giz-exploring-SF_Kate.png.webp 1922w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Second-set-of-Giz-exploring-SF_Kate-600x248.png.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Second-set-of-Giz-exploring-SF_Kate-800x331.png.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Second-set-of-Giz-exploring-SF_Kate-768x318.png.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Second-set-of-Giz-exploring-SF_Kate-1536x636.png.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Second-set-of-Giz-exploring-SF_Kate-250x104.png.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px" /></p>\n<h2>It’s Not All Smooth Sniffing</h2>\n<p>Of course, not everything has been a walk in the park (ha). The hardest things so far have been:</p>\n<h3>1. Yes, Virginia, there is an upstairs neighbor</h3>\n<p>Apartment neighbors are just a lot <i>closer</i>. Gizmo is working on understanding that upstairs neighbors are in fact allowed to walk around their own apartments, even when he is enjoying a much-needed nap.</p>\n<h3>2. Garbage is not food</h3>\n<p>The streets may be pre-stocked with delicious treats, but for some mysterious reason, we have to eat the snacks we brought from home. Absolutely brutal.</p>\n<h3>3. Sea lions are not actual lions</h3>\n<p>Although actual lions might stalk and eat a Gizmo on the open savannah, the sea lions that lounge like big blubbery sacks on the piers are not an actual threat. But one earful of their “roaring” and Gizmo is ready to be anywhere but there!</p>\n<h2>The Mysterious Mr. Giz</h2>\n<figure id="attachment_765090" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-765090" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-765090" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-yawning-in-front-of-the-San-Francisco-skyline_Kate.jpeg" alt="Gizmo yawning in front of the San Francisco skyline" width="450" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-yawning-in-front-of-the-San-Francisco-skyline_Kate.jpeg.webp 1200w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-yawning-in-front-of-the-San-Francisco-skyline_Kate-450x600.jpeg.webp 450w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-yawning-in-front-of-the-San-Francisco-skyline_Kate-750x1000.jpeg.webp 750w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-yawning-in-front-of-the-San-Francisco-skyline_Kate-768x1024.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-yawning-in-front-of-the-San-Francisco-skyline_Kate-1152x1536.jpeg.webp 1152w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-yawning-in-front-of-the-San-Francisco-skyline_Kate-250x333.jpeg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-yawning-in-front-of-the-San-Francisco-skyline_Kate-300x400.jpeg.webp 300w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gizmo-yawning-in-front-of-the-San-Francisco-skyline_Kate-600x800.jpeg.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-765090" class="wp-caption-text">Big city?

How does the math work in his brain if 1-3 people on the streets = dangerous but 4-infinity = no worries? What else has he been subtly trying to tell me over the years?</p>\n<p>Have you ever moved a suburban dog to the big city? Tell us about it in the comments!

involved in every part of my life, we frequently travel together. She flies with me, goes on roadtrips, and participates in all my adventures. As anyone who travels frequently with their dog will tell you, finding pet-friendly services in a place you’ve never been can be stressful.</p>\n<p>So, what if I told you that there is an app out there, with a directory of thousands of dog-specific locations, that can be filtered by the amenities you want? What if I told you that you can search for a slew of pet services wherever you travel? That’s the beauty of the <a href="https://www.dogpackapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">DogPack App</a>, an iOS and Android app that aims to be the one-stop shop for all dog-parenting needs. From a social network to an assistant providing daily care advice, this app is so much more than just a location finder.</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765109" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-website-home-page.jpg" alt="DogPack App Review -

Even when we are home, I am always seeking new adventures for my 9-year-old mixed-breed Lorelei. However, wherever we end up, it can be a headache to find pet-friendly spots to walk around or pet services should she need a groom when we’re out of state. I knew I had to check it out when DogPack came across my feed (no pun intended).</p>\n<p>Although I have used dog-friendly locator websites in the past, I never knew there could be a phone app for one! The fact that DogPack is a handy app attracted me to the service. I quickly downloaded DogPack to my Android phone and got started right away.</p>\n<p>Upon opening the app, I was prompted to create an account. No personal information was asked for, just my email, a username, and a password. DogPack then requested that I make a profile for my dog, although you can always do that later! I filled in Lorelei’s information.</p>\n<p>The app opened first to the Feed, allowing me to start interacting with other pet owners immediately! I enjoyed seeing so many cute snouts and faces; everyone’s dogs looked like they were having an absolute blast. The feed gives the same feeling as Instagram and had many of the same features (Liking, Commenting, etc.). I posted a few images of my dog and got some likes and interactions fairly quickly!</p>\n<p>When it came time to explore the Map, I enabled Location Permissions on my phone and had it search my current area. I was in Beverly Hills then, and was enthused to see so many markers populate the map. Each marker was a different color, indicating a Dog Park, Dog-Friendly Location, Service, Lodging, etc. I could toggle which markers I wanted to see on my map through a bar at the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>Some of the marker selections on the map were a bit glitchy &#8211; a couple of markers required multiple taps of my finger for it to open. But alas, it is a phone app, glitches happen! This did not impede my enjoyment of DogPack.</p>\n<p>I decided that I wanted to locate a dog park specifically, and was happy to see that you can filter parks by amenities as well. I opened up Magic Johnson Dog Park and got to view the park’s star rating, list of amenities, description, weather (this is a super nice touch), dog count, and more.</p>\n<p>DogPack can also be accessed on a web browser, and although it limits some of the features, it was just as convenient to use as the app. The web version did make it a bit easier to read the blogs, I will say.</p>\n<p>I found that DogPack had a much more extensive collection of pet-friendly businesses, dog parks, and outdoor locations than the other websites I have used in the past. The other present features, such as the breed guides, made for fun late-night reading if I couldn’t sleep.</p>\n<p>The in-app currency, Treats, was a cute little touch &#8211; I liked that you could get discounts on the product store for DogPack just by using the app. There is a lot of incentivization for interacting with DogPack, and I honestly cannot believe this app is free. It is such a great resource!</p>\n<h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>\n<div class="su-row"><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#006600;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#009906;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Completely free</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Directory of pet services</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Worldwide</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Page for lost and found pets</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Integrated social media</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Great blog, breed guides, and more</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Available for web, iOS, and Android</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#8c0000;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#bf000a;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Cons</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Like all apps, there are glitches</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\n<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765113" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-features.jpg" alt="DogPack App Review - features" width="1500" height="741" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-features.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-features-600x296.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-features-800x395.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-features-768x379.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-features-250x124.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.dogpackapp.com/" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Visit Their Website</span></a></div>\n<h3>Dog Park Location Finder</h3>\n<p>The crowning jewel of DogPack is the extensive map of dog parks and dog-friendly outdoor locations! You can use the location services on your phone or type in an area to search for dog parks and/or pet-friendly spots.</p>\n<p>The map is fully interactive and customizable, with paw print indicators in different colors to signify what location is what. You can even filter dog parks based on their amenities to find the exact kind of spot that you want to take Fido to.</p>\n<p>Depending on how many people are active in an area, there is even a live tracker for how many people checked in for a specific park and how many dogs may be there.</p>\n<h3>Pet Services Directory and Listings</h3>\n<p>DogPack also shows dog services worldwide, from groomers, trainers, photographers, and so much more. This is especially helpful for those traveling with their dogs who may be in need of various services at their destination. You can filter services by type or view all available in a specific area via the map. You can even find pet-friendly hotels and lodging included in the directory.</p>\n<p>For pet businesses, listing is completely free! You do need to have an account, however. This is a great additional advertising for your pet-based service.</p>\n<h3>Social Media Feed</h3>\n<p>There is a very social aspect of DogPack, which can make it easy to schedule pup-dates and park meet-ups. The app has an actual feed page that looks similar to Instagram and Facebook. People post photos of their pups with captions, and you can Like, Comment, or post your own. DogPack allows you to Follow people, and they can become your Follower in return.</p>\n<p>This is an excellent way to connect with other pet owners in your area and organize doggy meetups, playdates, pack walks, and so much more.</p>\n<h3>Lost &amp; Found Pets, Breed Listings, and More</h3>\n<p>As if the above wasn’t enough, DogPack is slowly becoming the go-to dog resource with additional features.</p>\n<p>There is a dedicated page to post lost dogs (anyone pinging in the same area will receive an alert to keep an eye out for their missing pup) and found dogs.</p>\n<p>DogPack has a pervasive Breed Guide page, with some rare and unique breeds listed. As a <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/common-guide-dog-breeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">dog breed enthusiast</a>, I can attest that the information I read on some uncommon breeds was sound and correct.</p>\n<p>The blog has a multitude of valuable and fun articles that help with all aspects of dog ownership. There is even a page dedicated to pet insurance!</p>\n<p>Earning Treats</p>\n<p>DogPack has an interesting rewards-based feature called Treats. Treats can be collected by referring friends to the app, completing specific tasks, or engaging and participating with DogPack. Treats can then be redeemed for rewards such as discounts on the DogPack store, raffle tickets, and even having your pup shared on the DogPack social media accounts.</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>About DogPack</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765112" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-welcome-to-the-app.jpg" alt="DogPack App Review - welcome to the app" width="1500" height="1168" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-welcome-to-the-app.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-welcome-to-the-app-600x467.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-welcome-to-the-app-800x623.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-welcome-to-the-app-768x598.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-welcome-to-the-app-250x195.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.dogpackapp.com/" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Visit Their Website</span></a></div>\n<div class="su-table breed-table su-table-alternate">\n<table width="623">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Founded:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">2021</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Headquarters:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Montreal, Canada</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Number of Listed Dog Parks:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Over 75,000 locations globally</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Community Engagement:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">DogPack socializes with its user base through local events, blogs, and more</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Core Principles:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Improve the lives of dog owners by providing a platform to explore dog-friendly parks and services</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Additional Offerings:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">DogPack also has a pet product store with harnesses, leashes, toys, and more</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Is the DogPack App a Good Value?</h2>\n<p>The DogPak App is free &#8211; yes, you read that right, free! That makes it the best value of all, right? Moreover, the app itself is a tremendous value for its directory of locations and services alone.</p>\n<p>For all of us who want our pets included in every aspect of our lives, having a service to peek through pet-friendly amenities quickly is a significant enhancement to<a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/fun-things-to-do-with-your-dog" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> daily dog ownership life</a>. Adding a lost and found page, a dog breeds page, and a helpful blog makes the DogPack App invaluable.</p>\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n<p>The beauty of an app is that all I needed was my phone &#8211; I could test the service from the comfort of my couch! I have an Android phone, so I scanned the QR code from the DogPack website and launched the Google Play Store. After downloading the app, I created an account and got to searching. I proceeded to visit a couple of the local locations and verified that the information on those parks is indeed very accurate!</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765111" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-app-filter.jpg" alt="DogPack App Review - app filter" width="1500" height="1093" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-app-filter.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-app-filter-600x437.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-app-filter-800x583.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-app-filter-768x560.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-app-filter-250x182.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.dogpackapp.com/" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Visit Their Website</span></a></div>\n<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\n<h3>Do You Have To Have An Account To Use DogPack?</h3>\n<p>You do not need an account to browse the parks and business directory, but you need an account to use the other services offered by DogPack App. Creating an account is free!</p>\n<h3>What Is The Difference Between a Dog-Friendly Area and a Dog Park?</h3>\n<p>On the DogPack App, a dog-friendly area is a space not specifically designated for dogs, but dogs are welcome to visit. Marked red on the map, these locations typically require dogs to remain on-leash and don’t tend to have dog-specific amenities or facilities.</p>\n<p>An official dog park is marked green on the map and considered an actual dog park designated area (whether by the city or a private business). These locations allow off-leash use, can be fenced in, and have dog-specific features.</p>\n<h3>A Dog Park I Know Of Isn’t On The App &#8211; How Can I Submit One?</h3>\n<p>With an account on DogPack, you can suggest parks that may not be on the database already. To do so, navigate to the Dog Park page, which opens up a map. You can access this page by searching for an area using the search bar, clicking the “Explore” button, and selecting “Parks” from the dropdown menu.</p>\n<p>Once the map loads, click the Suggest a Pin button. Once the pin is in the proper place on the map, you can fill out information about the dog park, and then press Suggest Pin to close the window. The park will be reviewed by a DogPack admin once approved, you will receive a notification, and the park will be on the map.</p>\n<h3>An Amenity Listed For a Park Isn’t There &#8211; What Now?</h3>\n<p>DogPack offers a way to verify whether or not specific listed amenities are correct. You can vote on park amenities by navigating to the Amenities section on the park page and clicking <em>Vote on the Available Amenities</em>. You can always change your vote if an amenity that was there before is now gone.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765114" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-amenities.jpg" alt="DogPack App Review - amenities" width="1500" height="1190" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-amenities.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-amenities-600x476.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-amenities-800x635.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-amenities-768x609.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DogPack-App-Review-amenities-250x198.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.dogpackapp.com/" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Visit Their Website</span></a></div>\n<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Sure, we all have the power of the internet in our pockets via smartphones, but it can require a lot of effort to find what we are looking for. <a href="https://www.dogpackapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">DogPack</a> makes this process simple for us dog owners by having everything you could want as a dog owner well-organized and in the palm of your hand!</p>\n<p>From finding dog-friendly locations, services, and even <a href="https://www.dogster.com/statistics/missing-and-lost-pet-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">posting a found pet</a> &#8211; I can’t imagine not using DogPack now!</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dogpack-app-review">DogPack App Review 2025: The Ultimate Tool for Fido’s Adventures</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/lisa-lee">Lisa Lee</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

over the country at least twice a month. My dog Lorelei has become quite acclimated to being my little adventure buddy, as I don’t fly or drive anywhere without her. But if you travel as often as I do, you know that dealing with luggage is a significant inconvenience no matter how hard you try, or how many years of experience you have in a nomadic lifestyle. Add a pet into that equation, and you’re definitely going to pull your hair out at least once.</p>\n<p>This is why finding the <em>right </em>travel carrier is vital &#8211; if you’re lugging around a bulky or inconvenient bag with your most precious cargo inside, the stress becomes astronomical. A lot of bags mean well, but I feel like they either haven’t been designed by someone who a) has a pet or b) needs to travel with one. This is where the many clever features of <a href="https://mrpeanutspetcarriers.com/products/expandable-airline-capable-tote?variant=29439029510167" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Mr. Peanut&#8217;s Gold Series Expandable Pet Carrier</a> struck my fancy. This feels like a bag created by someone who <em>understands</em> what you need on the road!

Before I even get into my experience, I want to express how incredibly thrilled I am with this bag &#8211; the features made flying so much easier (and less stressful) than any carrier I had used before.</p>\n<p>All of my carriers had originally come from Petco and were not collapsible. Color me surprised when this expandable carrier arrived at my doorstep fully folded with a dust bag! The carrier folds down quite flat and small, bedding included, which makes storage very easy. To build the bag back up, you just pull the center frame up and zip it into shape.</p>\n<p>Upon giving the carrier its shape, I could immediately feel how high-quality the construction is. The materials feel good in my hands and I kept discovering new features as I played with the bag. Even something as simple as the shoulder pad on the strap was well designed. My dog is 10 lbs, which isn’t particularly heavy by most dog owner standards, but definitely wears on your shoulder when carried for long periods of time. The shoulder strap is so well designed that the discomfort was well alleviated.</p>\n<p>Putting the carrier on the ground, my dog Lorelei climbed in without prompting or hesitation! My dog does fancy crates, kennels, and bags &#8211; but this was the first time that she had jumped in so fast. The faux fleece bedding gave her a cozy spot to rest, and she curled right up in comfort.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned before, we had a flight to Denver to catch. On our travel day, it was so easy to get this carrier from the car, to the terminal, through security, and onto the plane. I flew Southwest Airlines, which requires you to check in with an agent who weighs the bag, checks your pet, and gives you a luggage tag for in-cabin travel. This is the most stressful part of the experience, as they can deny your pet boarding for a number of reasons. As I am typing this from Colorado, I can attest that this bag fits all of the airline’s requirements in size, weight, and pet comfort. The bag breezed through TSA security with ease as well.</p>\n<p>While waiting at the gate, I used the expandable side to give Lorelei some more room to sprawl out. She loved it, and we got many compliments from strangers walking past. They were very enthused about the expandable side and how comfortable my dog was, as well as the aesthetic of the bag. I fly a lot, and this is the first time that a passerby actually stopped to talk about how nice the carrier looks.</p>\n<p>Another big stressor is making sure the bag fits comfortably under the seat in front once inside the plane. Passing the size inspection at check-in doesn’t necessarily mean your bag will be comfortable. On Southwest, it is an open seating policy, and I tend to opt for the middle seat because it actually has more room underneath than the window and the aisle &#8211; and as a rule, carriers do not fit in the aisle seat on most planes because there is an extra notch there. A kind gentleman invited Lorelei and I into the middle seat on the second row (we lucked out!), and the carrier fit underneath with ease. I didn’t even have to squish the top of it (which is why soft-sided carriers are recommended over the hard ones, you may need to squish a bit), it slid right in! The carrier even left room for my feet, which my previous one did not. Lorelei slept the entire 2.5-hour flight.</p>\n<p>Once we arrived, we grabbed a taxi to the hotel. Taxis can also deny you a ride if you have a dog, but the beauty of this bag is that it looks like a luggage duffel when all of the window shades are down (and you have a dog that doesn’t bark, like mine). I feel the leather handles and seams, along with the nice color, contribute to not looking like a “pet bag”. My driver had no idea I had a dog with me for the whole hour-long journey.</p>\n<p>Once in the hotel room, the carrier doubled as my dog’s kennel. I expanded the side so she had plenty of room. She slept in there comfortably at night, and I could zip her up without worry if I had to run down to the lobby to grab a plate of the complimentary breakfast or snag something from the shop. While at my work, the carrier continued to act as a kennel and Lorelei didn’t mind one bit.</p>\n<p>I see many, many years of adventures with this Gold Series bag, and wish I had it sooner.</p>\n<h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>\n<div class="su-row"><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#006600;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#009906;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Clever features</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Compatible with most airlines</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Five colors to choose from</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Expandable for extra room</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Removable fleece bedding</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Easy to clean with waterproof lining</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Built-in luggage strap and car seat belt</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Self-locking zippers</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#8c0000;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#bf000a;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Cons</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> The collar/harness clip is not removable</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Only one small zippered pocket for items</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765132" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-bag-strapped-in-car.jpg" alt="Mr. Peanut's Gold Series Expandable Pet Carrier Review -

I never had a carrier so set up for travel like this one. The travel-specific features of the Gold Series Expandable Pet Carrier include:</p>\n<div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Airline-compliant size and meeting FAA regulations</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Weighing only 3.4 lbs without your pet to not add more weight</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Luggage strap to attach to your suitcase</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Car seat belt strap to make vehicle transport easy</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Leash tether for harnesses inside the carrier</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Auto self-locking zippers all around</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Padded shoulder on the strap to make carrying for long hours less painful</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Name tag holder on the main strap</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Feet on the bottom of the bag</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Completely leak-proof</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Plenty of ventilation for your dog or cat</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Able to load pet from the top of the carrier or either side</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Zippered mesh pocket on the side for treats, supplies, or paperwork</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>Many Windows With Expandable Side</h3>\n<p>I counted a total of 5 windows, all made of mesh with rollaway covers so you can customize where your dog’s windows are (or open them all for a nice breeze)! The windows being available on all sides (and on the top) is very convenient, I can have my dog enjoy a nice view on one side and block her view from distractions on the other side.</p>\n<p>The expandable side, of course, is a top-selling feature of the Mr. Peanut&#8217;s Gold Series Expandable Pet Carrier &#8211; increasing the size of the carrier so your pup can sprawl out!</p>\n<h3>Bedding Included</h3>\n<p>Unlike other travel carriers, the Gold Series Expandable Pet Carrier comes with bedding for both the direct inside of the carrier and the expandable section.</p>\n<p>The faux fleece padding with composite base insert goes into the primary compartment (and is easily removable). The bottom is velcro to keep it in place, and this padding can be unzipped and thrown in the washing machine.</p>\n<p>The faux fleece padding for the expandable section is zipped into the wall side, so when you expand, you just zip it down to line that section.</p>\n<h3>Easy To Keep Clean</h3>\n<p>Actual pet owners clearly thought out the design of this carrier, because the entire bag is simple to clean. For starters, the lining inside of the Gold Series Expandable Pet Carrier is fully waterproof and leak-proof, making it easy to wipe up accidents. The outside of the carrier can be wiped down with water and soap in full, as the material is not bothered by moisture whatsoever.

Although this bag appears similar to other types of expandable carriers, there are notable differences that make it top-notch against the rest (as detailed in the Key Features section).</p>\n<p>Priced at $109, the cost is actually quite a bit less than the “airline approved” carriers I frequently see at shops like Petco and Petsmart, and most definitely less than having to buy one at the airport itself! For a product that will last you trip after trip, it is well worth the cost.</p>\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n<p>The most straightforward test is to put the carrier on the ground and see if my dog gets inside of her own free will &#8211; much to my amusement, she hopped right in there the second I opened the door! I have always found this to be an excellent sign, as my dog can be rather picky.</p>\n<p>I proceeded to put all of the features themselves to good use, such as the expandable side, luggage slip, window folds, and more. The <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/dog-car-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">carrier traveled in the car</a>, on a flight, in a hotel room, at an outdoor park, and so much more. Cleaning was a breeze as I could easily wipe it down with a moist rag.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765130" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-owner-using-carrier.jpg" alt="Mr. Peanut's Gold Series Expandable Pet Carrier Review - owner using carrier" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-owner-using-carrier.jpg 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-owner-using-carrier-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-owner-using-carrier-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-owner-using-carrier-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-owner-using-carrier-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-owner-using-carrier-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://mrpeanutspetcarriers.com/products/expandable-airline-capable-tote?variant=29439029510167" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on Mr. Peanut&#8217;s</span></a></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\n<h3>How Do I Make Sure My Pet Fits?</h3>\n<p>To make sure your pet is compatible, you’ll need to measure their height, width, and length <em>when they are lying down. </em>Pets at 16” in length when down are the best fit because this bag is sized at 18&#8243; exterior length, exterior width at 10.5”, and exterior height at 11” (and the inside dimensions are slightly smaller). This bag is best for pets who don’t weigh any more than 15 lbs.</p>\n<h3>I Need To Return My Carrier: What Is the Policy?</h3>\n<p>All unused and undamaged products are welcome to be returned at any time (alongside all their accessories). That being said, all return label fees are charged at cost, but Mr. Peanut’s does offer the unique opportunity to do a no-fee re-purchase if size or styling was an issue. With this, the return label cost is waived. Shipping fees are not refundable, however.</p>\n<p>Mr. Peanut’s urges used products to be donated to<a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/history-of-animal-shelters" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> local animal shelters and rescues</a>, as the company cannot accept them.</p>\n<h3>How Do I Train My Dog To Be Comfortable Inside the Carrier?</h3>\n<p>For dogs that don’t fancy carriers as much as mine does, you can certainly train them to be comfortable. The most important thing is to acclimate them to the bag, and show them that this is a safe and positive space:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduce the carrier in your pet’s most comfortable place, such as in the living room at home. Place treats or toys inside to encourage them to check the carrier out.</li>\n<li>Offer food near or inside the carrier, building a positive association. Reward every time they go inside of their own free will!</li>\n<li>Start practicing closing the carrier door while still offering treats and positive reinforcement. Gradually increase the time the dog is inside with the door zipped shut.</li>\n<li>Practice short trips so your pup gets used to the motion and travel aspect of the carrier.</li>\n<li>Remember that consistency and patience are the key to success! Continue offering positive reinforcement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Cats are a bit more fickle, but my experience has shown that they do enjoy carriers as a safe space once they are used to them. For cats…</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Leave the carrier out and open, and let your cat explore it.</li>\n<li>Make the carrier warm and inviting by offering blankets with your scent, toys, and for food-motivated cats, throw treats in there.</li>\n<li>Feed your cat inside the carrier to build a positive association.</li>\n<li>Practice short sessions with the carrier zipped shut and being carried around.</li>\n<li>If your cat still shows signs of discomfort but a trip is rapidly approaching, consider using veterinary-approved calming aids!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765131" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-dog-lying-in-carrier.jpg" alt="Mr. Peanut's Gold Series Expandable Pet Carrier Review - dog lying in carrier" width="1500" height="1126" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-dog-lying-in-carrier.jpg 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-dog-lying-in-carrier-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-dog-lying-in-carrier-800x601.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-dog-lying-in-carrier-768x577.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-dog-lying-in-carrier-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mr.-Peanuts-Gold-Series-Expandable-Pet-Carrier-Review-dog-lying-in-carrier-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://mrpeanutspetcarriers.com/products/expandable-airline-capable-tote?variant=29439029510167" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on Mr. Peanut&#8217;s</span></a></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I don’t think I’ll ever be able to use another carrier again, and this is coming from someone who has seven of them &#8211; I may need to figure out what to do with the other 6!

Bruce, our Australian Cattle Dog, has shorter fur and is built for warmer weather, but that didn’t stop his adventuring on our jaunt through the woods wearing the ororo heated vest.</p>\n<p>Anyone who spends time outdoors knows that bulky, cumbersome gear can turn an exciting outing into a tiring, frustrating one. I was pleasantly surprised with the Koldpwoof vest’s sleek, snug design, enabling the dogs to pass through thick forests without getting hung up on branches or debris. I left the vest on Bruce as we travelled through the forest; besides a few shakes, he barely seemed to notice it was there.</p>\n<p>Evie, our German Shepherd, enjoyed the vest, even opting to lay on the snow as it warmed her shoulders and back after our long hike.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, during the hike, the vest was prone to twisting slightly with fast movement, like running, twisting, or turning abruptly. I prefer the vest for the beginning and end of a hike as a warm-up and comforting end as their body temperature stays elevated while trailing through the forest at a run. This vest would be perfect to toss on during overnight camping trips, longer car rides after a chilly day, or any prolonged exercise in the elements.</p>\n<p>The adjustable vest fits three of our four dogs, which is terrific for multi-dog households. Not only does the vest have reflective stripes, but the ororo also lights with an LED glow during lowlight conditions for easy location and added safety.</p>\n<p>Active dogs, especially those with jobs tend to work happily in most conditions. The Koldpwoof dog vests ensure their efforts aren’t in vain by guaranteeing their comfort long after the day is done.</p>\n<h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>\n<div class="su-row"><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#006600;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#009906;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Easy to see colours</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Rechargeable battery</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Reflective stitching &amp; LED light for safety</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Four heating zones</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Multi-level overheat protection</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#8c0000;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#bf000a;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Cons</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Vest can twist with movement</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765142" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-wires.jpg" alt="ororo Koldpwoof Heated Dog Vest Review - wires" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-wires.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-wires-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-wires-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-wires-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-wires-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-wires-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.ororowear.com/products/heated-padded-dog-vest" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on ororo</span></a></div>\n<h3>Charging &amp; Battery Capabilities</h3>\n<p>The B22A and B25A batteries are rechargeable, with a 7.4V output. The battery can last up to 9.5 hours on low and 5 hours on high. With a 2.5-hour charge, the battery can quickly hit full capacity and be <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-to-make-a-dog-happy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ready for the next adventure</a>. The battery is curved to sit comfortably over the dog’s spine.</p>\n<p>The battery should not be left uncharged for long periods and should be recharged at least every 3 months.</p>\n<h3>Heating Zones</h3>\n<p>The Koldpwoof Heated Dog Vest has four heating zones. These zones sit above the right and left shoulder and along the right and left lower back. The vest will automatically switch from high heat to low heat after 15 minutes as a precaution and to prevent overheating. A quick look at the light (red for high heat, blue for low heat, and white for visibility) will inform you quickly which setting your dog’s vest is on.</p>\n<h3>Vest Material</h3>\n<p>The vest is made of a 100% nylon outer shell, with the lining and fill being 100% polyester. (See above for cleaning recommendations).</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>About ororo</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765145" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-vest-on-a-piece-of-wood.jpg" alt="ororo Koldpwoof Heated Dog Vest Review - vest on a piece of wood" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-vest-on-a-piece-of-wood.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-vest-on-a-piece-of-wood-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-vest-on-a-piece-of-wood-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-vest-on-a-piece-of-wood-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-vest-on-a-piece-of-wood-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-vest-on-a-piece-of-wood-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.ororowear.com/products/heated-padded-dog-vest" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on ororo</span></a></div>\n<div class="su-table breed-table su-table-alternate">\n<table width="623">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Manufacturing:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">ororo gear is manufactured in China at a plant that coincides with ororo’s standards</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Warranty:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">ororo offers a 3-year warranty on the carbon-fibre heating elements and 1 year on all batteries for their outerwear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Shipping:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">ororo ships throughout the US, Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Ororo’s over 2 million sales in 9 short years highlights their top quality apparel and accessories.

However, it remains affordable, given the quality of the material and batteries. Not only does ororo keep their prices affordable for high-quality gear, but their warranty policies deliver comfort and insurance to those investing in this particular vest.</p>\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n<p>As a multi-dog household in the mountains of BC, Canada, we experience cold weather for 5 to 6 months of the year. During the winter months, our dogs are rarely left behind on our outings, whether that be a horse ride, snowshoe, or hike to a mountain top, and to keep them all functioning at top performance, extra care is required as the temperature drops.</p>\n<p>To determine the best use for the ororo vest, I chose to try it on multiple dogs on different adventures and was happy to see the design held up for very active dogs in a rural setting.</p>\n<p>I’ll be glad to outfit my dog with this vest during camping in our warmer months as well, as the nights can get chilly, even for a dog with a fur coat.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765143" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-dog-wearing-vest.jpg" alt="ororo Koldpwoof Heated Dog Vest Review - dog wearing vest" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-dog-wearing-vest.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-dog-wearing-vest-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-dog-wearing-vest-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-dog-wearing-vest-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-dog-wearing-vest-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ororo-Koldpwoof-Heated-Dog-Vest-Review-dog-wearing-vest-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.ororowear.com/products/heated-padded-dog-vest" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on ororo</span></a></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\n<h3>How well does the vest wipe clean?</h3>\n<p>While adventuring, Fido is bound to kick up some mud or <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/how-to-clean-dog-paws-updated" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">splash through a puddle</a>.

animals in your life, custom gifts are some of the best ones you can give. Not only do they commemorate special memories, but they keep the memories alive every time you see them. Best of all, they’re gifts that last a lifetime.</p>\n<p>One of the best custom gifts I’ve seen for pet lovers is <a href="https://www.pupsentials.com/discount/dogster?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fbest-selling-collection%2Fproducts%2Fcustom-art-embroidery-sweatshirt" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">The Custom Embroidered Pet Portrait Sweatshirt from Pupsentials</a>. With this sweatshirt, a realistic portrait of your furry friend’s face is embroidered on the upper left side so you can have your four-legged soulmate close to your heart every time you wear it. The embroidery is done by hand with over 25,000 stitches, and the team at Pupsentials chooses from over 15 thread colors to get your furbaby’s coloring just right.</p>\n<p>I ordered a custom sweatshirt of my Goldendoodle, Micah, and absolutely love it.

So when I heard about Pupsentials, I immediately fell in love with their Custom Embroidered Pet Portrait Sweatshirt. I mean, who doesn’t want their dog’s face embroidered on a sweatshirt?</p>\n<p>After browsing their site and looking through their example photos, I decided on the clay-colored shirt. Next, I uploaded a photo of Micah. Choosing a straightforward image is super important, so I looked for the most forward-facing, well-lit photo I could find. A few days after placing the order, Pupsentials emailed me a proof. I didn’t have any revision requests, so I gave them the green light to start working on the design.</p>\n<p>The sweatshirt took a while to arrive, but once it did, I was super impressed. The sweatshirt was packaged in a cute mailer and wrapped in Pupsentials-branded tissue, which was equally adorable. What really caught my eye though, was the sweatshirt itself. From Micah’s embroidered face to his name on the sleeve, this <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/cutest-dog-breeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">might be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen</a>! Not only that, but the fit is exactly how you’d want a feel-good sweatshirt to fit. It’s cozy and roomy without being too big, and the inside has a soft, fuzzy texture. It also has a classy look. It&#8217;s comfy enough to cozy up on the couch in and stylish enough to wear out of the house.</p>\n<p>Given the oversized fit and unisex sizing, I went with a size small (my usual size). I’m 5’1 and like having a relaxed fit, so this was perfect. Pupsentials doesn’t currently offer an extra small, but even if they did, I wouldn’t size down.</p>\n<p>Despite seeing a ton of amazing reviews (it has over 800 five-star reviews), I wasn’t sure how Micah’s face would turn out embroidered on a shirt. But after seeing the final product, I think it’s safe to say these guys nailed it. They captured Micah’s personality so perfectly, which I honestly didn’t expect with embroidery, and they created a perfect rendition of<a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/goldendoodle-coat-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> Micah’s doodle fluff,</a> which I can imagine is not the easiest to replicate in a drawing, let alone stitching.</p>\n<p>While the price is high, when you factor in the time it takes to make each shirt (3+ hours) and the attention to detail (which is off the charts!), it’s understandable why the sweatshirt is on the expensive side. Micah’s proof alone had 10 different thread colors that were carefully chosen to match his coat coloring.</p>\n<p>At the time I placed this order, the estimated delivery was 4 weeks, but it could take as long as 8 weeks for your order to arrive. I didn’t order the sweatshirt for any <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/national-dog-holidays" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">special occasion</a> (other than celebrating Micah!), so the wait time wasn’t an issue for me. But if you need the sweatshirt by a certain date, this is something you’ll want to keep in mind, especially if you’re ordering during the holiday season.</p>\n<h2>Pros &amp; Cons</h2>\n<div class="su-row"><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#006600;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#009906;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> High quality</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Custom made</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Hand-drawn artwork</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Premium fabrics</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Comfortable</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Two free revisions</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Personalized text available</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#8c0000;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#bf000a;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Cons</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Expensive</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> Longer turnaround time</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765157" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-embroidery.jpg" alt="Pupsentials Custom Embroidered Pet Portrait Sweatshirt Review - embroidery" width="1500" height="1025" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-embroidery.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-embroidery-600x410.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-embroidery-800x547.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-embroidery-768x525.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-embroidery-250x171.jpg.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.pupsentials.com/discount/dogster?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fbest-selling-collection%2Fproducts%2Fcustom-art-embroidery-sweatshirt" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on Pupsentials</span></a></div>\n<h3>How it Works</h3>\n<p>Ordering a sweatshirt is pretty easy. After choosing a color and a size, you’ll select the number of pets you want embroidered on the shirt. If you want more than two pets, you’ll need to click the “3-5 Pets” link in the navigation bar. Next, you’ll upload a photo of your furry friend. Be sure the photo is forward-facing, close up, and in natural light. If you can’t decide which photo is best, you can upload more than one, and the Pupsentials team will choose one for you. Once you upload a photo and check out, you’re all set!</p>\n<p>The team at Pupsentials will process your order within 24-48 business hours and get started on the artwork. Before your order ships, they’ll send you a proof via email. You’ll have 7 days to approve the artwork or request revisions, and once you approve the proof, it’ll be sent for production. It’s important to keep in mind that the turnaround time is long, so be sure to plan ahead!</p>\n<h3>Custom Embroidery</h3>\n<p>This company is all about high-quality embroidery, so it’s no surprise that their embroidered artwork is top-notch. They use over 25,000 stitches and choose from a variety of thread colors to ensure your embroidered pet portrait looks exactly like your pup. They also create each portrait by hand, so you get the most lifelike image of your furry friend.</p>\n<p>For an additional cost, you can add custom-embroidered text to the sweatshirt. This is a really neat feature that gives your shirt a little extra love by adding text under your pet’s embroidered portrait or along the shirt’s sleeve cuff. The text can be either a name or a short message, and you can choose from a variety of icons (heart, dog bone, paw print, etc.) to go with it. You can also choose the thread color and font.</p>\n<p>I received custom text of Micah’s name with a heart icon on the sleeve, and it looks <em>amazing</em>! I absolutely recommend going the extra mile and adding text to your sweatshirt.</p>\n<h3>Stylish and Comfortable</h3>\n<p>Pupsentials created their own blank sweatshirt to ensure you have a shirt you’ll love wearing.. It’s a heavyweight unisex sweatshirt that was improved in the spring of 2024 to include hand-drawn artwork and premium fabrics (450 GSM 80% cotton 20% poly blend). Pupsentials also began embroidering directly into the sweatshirt to make sure it lasts a lifetime.</p>\n<p>As far as comfort goes, this is a really comfortable shirt. The material is soft and cozy without being heavy, and the inside has a fuzzy, pillowy texture that’s soft enough to sleep in. The sweatshirt is also designed with a relaxed fit to maximize comfort. Since the shirt is oversized, Pupsentials recommends sizing down if you want it to fit true to size.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>About Pupsentials</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765158" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-sweatshirt-folded.jpg" alt="Pupsentials Custom Embroidered Pet Portrait Sweatshirt Review -

This is a high-quality sweatshirt, and Pupsentials gives you the VIP experience with hand-drawn art, premium fabric, and life-like embroidery. After considering the time and expertise it takes to make each design, I’d say this sweatshirt is a great value, and I would highly recommend ordering one if it’s in your budget. The finished product is well worth the wait!</p>\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n<p>Before placing an order, I read through the instructions and guidelines on Pupsentials’ website. Since the sweatshirt is a custom item, there were a few things I wanted to know before placing an order, like what kind of photo to submit, how many revisions I could request, and how long delivery would take. After I read through the information, I chose a sweatshirt color and size and uploaded a photo of Micah.</p>\n<p>Once the sweatshirt arrived, I tried it on to see how it fit. I ordered a size small, and it fits exactly how I expected it to–oversized with plenty of room. The shirt is designed to have a relaxed fit, so if you want it to fit true to size, it’s best to size down.</p>\n<p>I also threw it in the wash (inside out with gentle detergent and cold water) and let it air dry to see how it would turn out. It’s always a bummer when sweatshirts shrink or change after one wash, but this one held up great and still looks new.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765155" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-dog-with-the-shirt.jpg" alt="Pupsentials Custom Embroidered Pet Portrait Sweatshirt Review - dog with the shirt" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-dog-with-the-shirt.jpg 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-dog-with-the-shirt-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-dog-with-the-shirt-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-dog-with-the-shirt-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-dog-with-the-shirt-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pupsentials-Custom-Embroidered-Pet-Portrait-Sweatshirt-Review-dog-with-the-shirt-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://www.pupsentials.com/discount/dogster?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fbest-selling-collection%2Fproducts%2Fcustom-art-embroidery-sweatshirt" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Price on Pupsentials</span></a></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\n<h3>What colors are available?</h3>\n<p>The sweatshirt comes in the following colors:</p>\n<div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Tan</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Charcoal</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Midnight black</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Candy pink</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Ivory</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Mint</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Alpine green</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Clay</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-paw" style="color:#2575BB"></i> Light blue</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>Can I include more than one pet?</h3>\n<p>You can include up to 5 pets on one sweatshirt.</p>\n<h3>Does Pupsentials embroider pets other than dogs?</h3>\n<p>Yes!

The only thing that makes travelling better is doing so with your four-legged friend!</p>\n<p>In 2008, a dog named Gunner changed the world for his owner, and now, countless dogs in North America. Being a bird dog, Gunner spent most of his life alongside owner Addison in a side-by-side or truck bed, duck hunting. Inspired by the desire to keep his beloved dog safe, Addison constructed his first kennel and the GUNNER brand was born.</p>\n<p>GUNNER, established in Nashville, TN, has an entire line of dog food crates, bowls, bumpers, and kennels to feed, train, and transport your dog efficiently and, most importantly, safely. GUNNER is built around crash-tested products, a unique design that accommodates real-world, rugged use.

Rural dog owners can attest to a myriad of critters interested in their dog food. In the mountains of BC, Canada, we’ve had skunks, raccoons, bears, wandering dogs, weasels, and more sniffing around our dog food supply. GUNNER’s dog food crate comes out of the box, assembled, and ready to seal every morsel into the crate to keep it away from pests. We’ve used the crate to store dog treats, cat food, and horse grain &#8211; consider this a multi-purpose container on our farm.</p>\n<p>The draw lock and security pin are easy for humans to open and close, but less so for dogs. My Australian Cattle Dog, Bruce, tried his hardest to sniff the lid open, to no avail. Weighing in at a mere 7.6 lbs, the easy-carry handle lifts and distributes the weight of an empty or full crate, making one-handed carry simple without tipping or spilling. I loaded up my two youngest dogs, Bruce, mentioned above, and my GSD, Evie, for a romp in the bush, placing the full food crate in the truck bed with them. The crate remained so airtight that the dogs barely bothered with it (and believe me, I’ve lost several sandwiches to wandering dog snouts).</p>\n<p>Most dog owners are unaware that opening a bag of kibble ignites the degradation of the food inside. GUNNER’s airtight food crate stops that from happening, ensuring your dog’s food stays fresh longer. So, even in the hot summer sun, your best (dog) friend is staying healthy with this crate.</p>\n<p>The snow is barely off the ground in BC, but a camping trip with this crate would be an absolute must. To trial and discover GUNNER’s full potential, I shared this food crate and dog bowl with a fellow houndsman who went hunting in the East Kootenays, BC, on snowmobiles. We had a chuckle at his previously used dog bowls that were chewed the entire way around the top &#8211; not gonna happen with GUNNER’s dog bowl. Reports are that even when strapped to the back of a sled, which has been trailing cats for days, the food has remained dry, safe, and usable all trip long. That’s a glowing review!</p>\n<h3>Pros &amp; Cons</h3>\n<div class="su-row"><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#006600;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#009906;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Pros</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Critter/pest proof</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Easy to clean</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Prevents mold and moisture</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Affordable high-quality material</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Made of food-safe materials</li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-check" style="color:#00bf08"></i> Stackable dog bowl with lid</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div><div class="su-column su-column-size-1-2"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim"><div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#8c0000;border-radius:0px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#bf000a;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:0px;border-top-right-radius:0px">Cons</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:0px;border-bottom-right-radius:0px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-ban" style="color:#bf000a"></i> The dog bowl is pricey</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765170" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-lock.jpg" alt="GUNNER Food Crate &amp; Dog Bowl Review - lock" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-lock.jpg.webp 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-lock-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-lock-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-lock-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-lock-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-lock-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="http://gunner.pxf.io/MA2GoN" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Latest Price</span></a></div>\n<h3>PunchSeal Technology</h3>\n<p>GUNNER’s dog bowl is made of highly durable nylon, with a lid that seals using PunchSeal technology. That means this dog bowl holds kibble, freeze-dried raw food, and water without spilling a drop. Rust typically comes with water; however, this dog bowl is rust- and impact-resistant.</p>\n<h3>Raised Feet &amp; Recessed Handle</h3>\n<p>Much like the G1 Dog Kennel, GUNNER’s dog food crate has raised feet to keep the crate from hot or cold surfaces. The recessed handle (50lb crate) and the strap (30lb crate) enable a balanced carry without tipping or pitching forward.</p>\n<h3>Draw Lock &amp; Security Pin</h3>\n<p>GUNNER’s dog food crate is designed with a draw lock that cinches the cover onto the container for a waterproof and airtight seal. Without water or moisture, mold does not form or spoil the food. The draw lock would be difficult for any critter to figure out, but the added security from the security pin guarantees your food only goes to the critters you want it to, when you want it to.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>About GUNNER</h2>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765171" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-product-outdoors.jpg" alt="GUNNER Food Crate &amp; Dog Bowl Review - product outdoors" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-product-outdoors.jpg 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-product-outdoors-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-product-outdoors-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-product-outdoors-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-product-outdoors-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-product-outdoors-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://gunner.pxf.io/mOj9rZ" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Latest Price</span></a></div>\n<div class="su-table breed-table su-table-alternate">\n<table width="623">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Manufacturing:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Made in the USA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Returns &amp; Refunds:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Up to 30-day returns on any unused item for a full refund</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Warranty:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">The dog food crate offers a Lifetime manufacturer’s warranty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="90"><strong>Shipping:</strong></td>\n<td width="290">Shipping within the USA and Canada.

Still, compared to others on the market, you would be subject to purchasing the same product repeatedly due to cracking, critter interference, or cumbersome containment.</p>\n<p>The dog food crate and bowl are designed to fit a lifestyle that relies on sturdy, durable products that accommodate less-than-ideal conditions. GUNNER’s products are of the standard you purchase once, and use for many years.</p>\n<h3>How We Tested</h3>\n<p>I wanted to test out GUNNER’s products because we have <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/how-to-train-two-dogs-at-once" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">an active, multi-dog household</a> and farm. We hike, camp, ride horses, move sheep, and kayak with our dogs, so high-quality, durable products are what I gravitate towards purchasing. GUNNER did not disappoint. In general, we feed our dogs raw food, but during adventures, we switch them to a freeze-dried raw option (and usually spend half the trip cleaning spilled dog food or losing a few mouthfuls to an over zealous pooch), but with the food storage crate, all of our food remained where it belongs.</p>\n<p>The products stood up to the test in my busy household, and my friend took them out on his snowmobiling adventure, and they remained strong there too!</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765172" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-dog-eating-from-bowl.jpg" alt="GUNNER Food Crate &amp; Dog Bowl Review - dog eating from bowl" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-dog-eating-from-bowl.jpg 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-dog-eating-from-bowl-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-dog-eating-from-bowl-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-dog-eating-from-bowl-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-dog-eating-from-bowl-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-dog-eating-from-bowl-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="http://gunner.pxf.io/MA2GoN" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Latest Price</span></a></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>\n<h3>Can I personalize my dog food crate and bowl?</h3>\n<p>Yes, while placing your online order, you can personalize both the dog bowl and dog food crate with your pup’s name. This is an excellent feature for multi-dog households with different feeding regimes.</p>\n<h3>How durable is this product?</h3>\n<p>Both the crate and bowl are made of easy-to-clean, long-lasting material. The dog bowl is impact resistant, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-behavior/why-do-dogs-chew-bones" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">chew deterrent</a>, and rust resistant.</p>\n<p>The food bowl is made of ultra-strong nylon and is dishwasher-approved (top-rack). The food crate’s lip allows for complete drainage after washing. For extra long soaks, washing can be done with dish soap or white vinegar. It is recommended to clean the food crate every few fills as oil from the kibble can begin to go rancid.</p>\n<h3>What if I have multiple dogs and need a larger food crate?</h3>\n<p>GUNNER’s dog crate options are the Food Crate 30 and 50. If you’re heading to camp and require multiple feedings or have multiple dogs, the Food Crate 50 would be your best bet. For weekend warriors or smaller excursions and packs, the Food Crate 30 holds a little less food with all the same great features.</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-765173" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-two-dogs-with-gunner.jpg" alt="GUNNER Food Crate &amp; Dog Bowl Review - two dogs with gunner" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-two-dogs-with-gunner.jpg 1500w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-two-dogs-with-gunner-600x450.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-two-dogs-with-gunner-800x600.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-two-dogs-with-gunner-768x576.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-two-dogs-with-gunner-250x188.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GUNNER-Food-Crate-Dog-Bowl-Review-two-dogs-with-gunner-500x375.jpg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>\n<div class="su-button-center"><a href="https://gunner.pxf.io/mOj9rZ" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#FF6600;border-color:#cc5200;border-radius:12px" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 30px;font-size:22px;line-height:44px;border-color:#ff944d;border-radius:12px;text-shadow:none"> Check Latest Price</span></a></div>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716648" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 3 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-04-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I was thrilled to try <a href="https://gunner.pxf.io/mOj9rZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">GUNNER’s products</a>.

Having a predictable schedule of meals and exercise allows them to relax, safe in the knowledge that at a certain time of day, the leash comes out, the bowls come down, and fun or food are on the way. But what if I told you that there’s another way of doing things?</p>\n<h2>Molly the Clock-Watcher</h2>\n<p>Many years ago, I had a patient named Molly. She was a gorgeous black Labrador, much like my Poppy, and she was always cheerful, gentle, and well-behaved. One day, she was in the hospital having a dental, and was due to go home at around 3 pm. However, there was an accident on the motorway and her owners were stuck in traffic, unable to collect her til almost 6 pm. This wasn’t a problem, except that we couldn’t give her a snack as she had severe food allergies and was on a specific prescription diet, but Molly didn’t seem to mind.</p>\n<p>Molly had been quiet and calm all day. We’d taken her for a walk, and she had spent most of the afternoon snoozing in her kennel. A few minutes after 5 pm, the whining started. We took her out, assuming she needed the toilet, but evidently, that wasn’t the problem. Back in her kennel, she started pacing and whining, pulling at the door, and giving the occasional yip. It was completely out of character for this mild-mannered retriever. When her owners finally arrived, I mentioned her unusual behavior, and they smiled knowingly.</p>\n<p>“Ah yes, she gets fed at 5 pm on the dot every day.”</p>\n<p>Well, I knew that dogs were able to keep a rough track of the time of day, but I’d never met one who was quite so precise. Kudos to Molly’s owners for being so strict about meal times, but I realized that it wasn’t something I wanted to do.</p>\n<p>What I’d seen with Molly was a dog who had come to rely on the predictability of her schedule so much that it caused her stress and anxiety when that schedule wasn’t strictly followed. Sure, one could argue that it might be why she was so chilled out the rest of the time, but I wondered if her owners also felt anxiety if, like on that day, they weren’t going to be home in time for her 5 pm meal.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_765185" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-765185" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-765185 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/They-do-know-when-food-is-being-prepared_Dr-Karyn-800x570.jpg" alt="They do know when food is being prepared" width="800" height="570" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/They-do-know-when-food-is-being-prepared_Dr-Karyn-800x570.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/They-do-know-when-food-is-being-prepared_Dr-Karyn-600x428.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/They-do-know-when-food-is-being-prepared_Dr-Karyn-768x547.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/They-do-know-when-food-is-being-prepared_Dr-Karyn-250x178.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/They-do-know-when-food-is-being-prepared_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-765185" class="wp-caption-text">They do know when food is being prepared</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Casual Routine</h2>\n<p>Things in our home are decidedly less regimented; it’s organized chaos, you might say. Our house is always kept neat and tidy, but our schedules are decidedly less so. If we were to get our dogs accustomed to being fed at a set time each day, we would inevitably be letting them down on a regular basis, which isn’t fair to them or us. So we use a slightly different scheduling method we like to call ‘casual routine.’</p>\n<p>Rather than feeding the dogs (and cats) at 7 am every morning and 7 pm every night, we have a 2-3 hour window where they will be fed. In a similar way, they don’t get walked at a specific time every day, and to be completely honest, they don’t get walked every day. Some days we just play in the garden, and on miserable, wet, and windy days, we’ll <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/indoor-dog-games" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">play games and hide things around the house</a> to keep everyone busy.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_765186" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-765186" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-765186 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fred-loves-his-chicken_Dr-Karyn-800x483.jpg" alt="Fred loves his chicken" width="800" height="483" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fred-loves-his-chicken_Dr-Karyn-800x483.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fred-loves-his-chicken_Dr-Karyn-600x363.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fred-loves-his-chicken_Dr-Karyn-768x464.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fred-loves-his-chicken_Dr-Karyn-250x151.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fred-loves-his-chicken_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-765186" class="wp-caption-text">Fred loves his chicken</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I often see neighbors walking their dogs in the driving rain, sleet, or hail, slaves to their routine, knowing their dog will go stir crazy without their 4 pm walk. I admire their dedication, but I can’t help chuckling to myself as well. Obviously, for those who aren’t as fortunate as we are to have a garden, taking your dog for a walk rain, hail, or shine is a necessity, but I know plenty of people whose dogs won’t go to the toilet at home; they’ll only go when they’re out on a walk.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, if the cats haven’t been fed by 8 pm, or the dog’s breakfast hasn’t been served by 10 am, things start to get a bit rowdy; there’s no chance of anyone missing out on a meal! But they’re not pacing the floor, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-training/how-to-stop-your-dog-from-scratching-the-door" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">scratching at doors</a>, or filing complaints if it’s ten past six and they haven’t eaten; they know they’ll be fed. They’re just as happy to pee or poop in the garden as they are on a walk, and if it’s cold and miserable outside, they seem more than happy to spend the day indoors, darting out briefly to relieve themselves before returning to the comfort and warmth of blankets and laps.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_765187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-765187" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-765187 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ned-and-Fred-follow-our-time-not-the-other-way-around_Dr-Karyn-800x573.jpg" alt="Ned and Fred follow our time, not the other way around" width="800" height="573" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ned-and-Fred-follow-our-time-not-the-other-way-around_Dr-Karyn-800x573.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ned-and-Fred-follow-our-time-not-the-other-way-around_Dr-Karyn-600x430.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ned-and-Fred-follow-our-time-not-the-other-way-around_Dr-Karyn-768x550.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ned-and-Fred-follow-our-time-not-the-other-way-around_Dr-Karyn-250x179.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ned-and-Fred-follow-our-time-not-the-other-way-around_Dr-Karyn.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-765187" class="wp-caption-text">Ned and Fred follow our time, not the other way around.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Do What Works For You</h2>\n<p>If a strict routine is what works for you, then that’s great. But if, like me, you want the occasional sleep-in, to have one more drink before heading home, or prefer to open the door a crack to let the dogs out to the toilet instead of braving the cold, then perhaps a casual routine will work for you. At the end of the day, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/do-dogs-know-when-were-stressed" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">your dogs will feel stressed if you are stressed</a>, and they are far more adaptable than we might think.

46	Barkseat Drivers: Lava, Hela and Lajka Battle for the Best Seat	<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/barkseat-drivers-dogs-battle-for-best-seat">Barkseat Drivers: Lava, Hela and Lajka Battle for the Best Seat</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-maja-platisa">Dr. Maja Platisa DVM MRCVS (Veterinarian)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

However, we appreciate that you like the article and would love it if you continued sharing just the first paragraph of an article, then linking out to the rest of the piece on Dogster.com.</p>\n<p><strong>Hi, I’m Dr. Maja! <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/maja-lava-and-hela-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Read my introduction</a> to learn more about me and my two crossbreed dogs, Lava and Hela.</strong></p>\n<p>Having a big car and one dog is a dream come true. There is room for everything. Lava and I used to take long-distance road trips, and we always had enough room for all our supplies. Then Hela joined the pack, and it became a little bit more crowded. Both dogs were sitting on the back seat, with a gate between them, as Lava is an avid barker and whiner in the car. She will produce a variety of sounds, especially if she sees anything interesting outside. And finally, Lajka came as the third dog. Luckily, she is fairly small, but the car seems to have gotten smaller, as well.</p>\n<h3>Back Seat Drama</h3>\n<p>For the last year and a half, Lava and Hela have been riding in the back seat of the car. Since they are both big dogs, there is only the boot and very little space in front of the back seats for any stuff. So, slowly, an idea started to form in my head of getting a large crate that can fit in the boot and allow the dogs to be comfortable enough for shorter trips.</p>\n<p>A major reason for this change was my worry that Lava, being so vocal and reactive when seeing other dogs outside of the window, may turn to Hela as a way to express her frustration, due to not being able to reach the outside dog. It hasn’t happened yet, but I know Lava well enough to expect that it may. Hela has also taken on the role of <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/dogs-and-barking-getting-lava-hela-lajka-to-stop" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">barking at random things</a> she sees outside, and occasionally whining, but nowhere near as bad as Lava. By moving them to the boot, they wouldn’t be able to see the outside world as much, and what they can’t see can’t upset them.</p>\n<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-765230" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-in-the-passenger-seat-of-Dr-Majas-car.jpeg" alt="Lava in the passenger seat of Dr Maja's car" width="603" height="804" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-in-the-passenger-seat-of-Dr-Majas-car.jpeg.webp 1400w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-in-the-passenger-seat-of-Dr-Majas-car-450x600.jpeg.webp 450w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-in-the-passenger-seat-of-Dr-Majas-car-750x1000.jpeg.webp 750w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-in-the-passenger-seat-of-Dr-Majas-car-768x1024.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-in-the-passenger-seat-of-Dr-Majas-car-1152x1536.jpeg.webp 1152w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-in-the-passenger-seat-of-Dr-Majas-car-250x333.jpeg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-in-the-passenger-seat-of-Dr-Majas-car-300x400.jpeg.webp 300w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lava-in-the-passenger-seat-of-Dr-Majas-car-600x800.jpeg.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></p>\n<h3>Dog Hair Everywhere</h3>\n<p>Another big reason for the change was also the abundance of dog hair that has started to become ever-present. In reality, it was always present, but it started to bother me a bit more, as it was very inconvenient if I had to drive anyone other than my mum, who is used to the hair. The car is now becoming almost impossible to clean, as there are nooks and crannies that are hard to reach. And <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-to-clean-up-dog-hair" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">dog hair finds its way everywhere</a> and loves to stick to everything. It’s a daily battle, and after a two-hour drive, the car looks as if it has never been cleaned in its working life.</p>\n<h3>Lajka Has a Special Spot</h3>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-765228" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-riding-in-the-front-seat_Dr-Maja.jpeg" alt="Lajka riding in the front seat" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-riding-in-the-front-seat_Dr-Maja.jpeg.webp 1200w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-riding-in-the-front-seat_Dr-Maja-600x450.jpeg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-riding-in-the-front-seat_Dr-Maja-800x600.jpeg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-riding-in-the-front-seat_Dr-Maja-768x576.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-riding-in-the-front-seat_Dr-Maja-250x188.jpeg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lajka-riding-in-the-front-seat_Dr-Maja-500x375.jpeg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>\n<p>Lajka, being the smallest, had the most desirable spot in the car. She used to sleep on my lap if I was the passenger, or would get the whole back seat to herself. This way, there is more room for our things, and she would pick a side she wants to sleep on. Being small, she doesn’t really try to look out of the window, and she will rarely bark. To be honest, most of the time, I forget she is even there until she starts to snore.</p>\n<h3>New Arrangements</h3>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-765227" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-and-Lajka-happy-in-the-crate-in-the-back-of-Dr-Majas-car.jpeg" alt="Hela and Lajka happy in the crate in the back of Dr Maja's car" width="802" height="602" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-and-Lajka-happy-in-the-crate-in-the-back-of-Dr-Majas-car.jpeg.webp 1200w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-and-Lajka-happy-in-the-crate-in-the-back-of-Dr-Majas-car-600x450.jpeg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-and-Lajka-happy-in-the-crate-in-the-back-of-Dr-Majas-car-800x600.jpeg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-and-Lajka-happy-in-the-crate-in-the-back-of-Dr-Majas-car-768x576.jpeg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-and-Lajka-happy-in-the-crate-in-the-back-of-Dr-Majas-car-250x188.jpeg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hela-and-Lajka-happy-in-the-crate-in-the-back-of-Dr-Majas-car-500x375.jpeg.webp 500w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /></p>\n<p>And now, finally, after a few weeks of waiting, there is a dog crate in the boot, an improvised one, made by a local handyman. It isn’t perfect, and I already see some faults that I couldn’t anticipate beforehand, but it is serving the purpose. Hela seems to like it, as much as I can tell, while Lava absolutely hates it, with a passion. In general, she just dislikes being in the boot, as she can’t see the world outside so well, which means there is no real reason to bark. And in Lava’s eyes, that’s a disaster. Also, with her being so big, it does get a bit crowded, even though she can lie down. Although the initial idea was for Hela and Lava to be in the crate, for longer trips, Lava still gets her wish and enjoys the back seat, “barking her eyes out,” while Lajka goes in the crate next to Hela. And the two of them love each other, so in a way, it’s a win-win for them all. Who cares what I want?</p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#00285e;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#1E5B91;color:#ffffff;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article is a part of Dr. Maja's series with her three dogs.</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#FAA41A"></i> <strong>Read her previous article: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/adventure-dogs-lajkas-explorations" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Adventure Dogs: Lajka&#8217;s Explorations</a><br />\n</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/doggos-weekly/barkseat-drivers-dogs-battle-for-best-seat">Barkseat Drivers: Lava, Hela and Lajka Battle for the Best Seat</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-maja-platisa">Dr. Maja Platisa DVM MRCVS (Veterinarian)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

Thanks to a team of scientists at <a href="https://colossal.com/de-extinction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Colossal Laboratories and Biosciences</a>, the first and only de-extinction company, this particular area of science may be one step closer to being fact, not fiction…or is it?</p>\n<p>The US company recently made headlines by announcing that in October 2024, they had successfully brought the dire wolf back to life, in the form of Remus and Romulus, named for the twin brothers who, according to ancient mythology, were raised by a she-wolf and responsible for the founding of Rome. Three months later, they were joined by a female pup named Khaleesi, a name plucked from the phenomenally popular Game of Thrones series. Of course, serious fans may take umbrage at the idea of the Stark family sigil being named after the Mother of Dragons!</p>\n<p>While it may be easy to be distracted by the hype surrounding such an exciting scientific breakthrough, one needs only scratch the surface of Colossal’s research to see that this may not be the giant leap in genetics they’d have us believe.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_765298" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-765298" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-765298 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/two-white-polar-wolf-stands-in-the-background-of-the-forest_photomaster_Shutterstock-800x534.jpg" alt="two white polar wolf stands in the background of the forest" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/two-white-polar-wolf-stands-in-the-background-of-the-forest_photomaster_Shutterstock-800x534.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/two-white-polar-wolf-stands-in-the-background-of-the-forest_photomaster_Shutterstock-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/two-white-polar-wolf-stands-in-the-background-of-the-forest_photomaster_Shutterstock-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/two-white-polar-wolf-stands-in-the-background-of-the-forest_photomaster_Shutterstock-250x167.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/two-white-polar-wolf-stands-in-the-background-of-the-forest_photomaster_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-765298" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: photomaster, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>The Colossol Movement</h2>\n<p>The razzle dazzle of Collosal’s website feels less like that of a genetics lab, and more like an enormous sales pitch, dripping with enough buzzwords and hyperbole to get any investor’s heart racing.</p>\n<div class="su-quote su-quote-style-default su-quote-has-cite"><div class="su-quote-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim">Combining the science of genetics with the business of discovery, we endeavor to jumpstart nature’s ancestral heartbeat.

While their plans to bring back animals like the Dodo or Thylacine (aka Tasmanian Tiger), whose disappearance from the planet was the direct result of senseless over-hunting, may be considered a noble attempt to right some human wrongs, one has to wonder about the virtue of reintroducing creatures whose demise was the result of natural selection. To which “rightful place in the ecosystem” are they referring?</p>\n<p>A genetically distinct species from extant canines, <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/game-of-thrones-direwolves" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">the dire wolf</a> – <em>Aenocyon dirus – </em>disappeared from the Earth around 10 to 16 thousand years ago. Although the time of their extinction has some overlap with the arrival of humans on the North American continent, most paleontologists believe that the giant canine predator was simply unable to compete with the smaller, more agile canid species.</p>\n<p>Similarly, another focus of Colossal’s de-extinction program, the Woolly Mammoth, became extinct around 10 to 12 thousand years ago. A close relative, but not ancestor, of today’s elephant species, the mammoth’s extinction has been attributed to the shift in habitat and ecosystems seen at the end of the Pleistocene epoch. Although the pressure of hunting by humans may have been a feature as the ice age drew to a close, it is unlikely to have been significant enough to play a major role in their extinction.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_765300" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-765300" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-765300 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Three-wolves-marching-together_David-Dirga_Shutterstock-800x534.jpg" alt="Three wolves marching together" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Three-wolves-marching-together_David-Dirga_Shutterstock-800x534.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Three-wolves-marching-together_David-Dirga_Shutterstock-600x400.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Three-wolves-marching-together_David-Dirga_Shutterstock-768x512.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Three-wolves-marching-together_David-Dirga_Shutterstock-250x167.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Three-wolves-marching-together_David-Dirga_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-765300" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: David Dirga, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>What Is De-Extinction, and Why Is It Happening?</h2>\n<p>The animals that Colossol claims to have brought back from extinction are dire wolves in name only. Due to a lack of viable DNA found in fossilized remains, the animals created in Colossol’s lab are the result of manipulating the <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/husky-vs-wolf" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">genes of the common gray wolf, </a><em>Canis lupus,</em> to create an analogue to the dire wolf, and its classification as <em>Aenocyon dirus</em> is controversial.</p>\n<p>Although the question of whether or not Remus, Romulus, and Khaleesi are indeed dire wolves is up for debate, Colossal’s scientists are excited for what their creations may mean for other de-extinction and species preservation efforts.</p>\n<p>One of the more challenging aspects of bringing a species back from the brink of extinction is the inherent lack of genetic diversity within a dwindling population. Through genetic manipulation, scientists are hopeful that they can increase this diversity within a natural population, giving an endangered species a better chance of survival, and this is the real value of their groundbreaking work. It is perhaps just a little less headline-grabbing than bringing a species back from extinction.</p>\n<h3>Why the Dire Wolf?</h3>\n<p>You might wonder why Colossal would choose to start with a species that was not a victim of modern hunting or habitat destruction, or one with a bit more ‘wow’ factor. Thanks to Game of Thrones, the dire wolf has just enough star power to grab headlines, whilst not being so <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/how-big-are-wolves-compared-to-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">physiologically different from modern-day wolves</a> as to be problematic in terms of care and husbandry – the ideal ambassador for less ‘exciting’ species.</p>\n<p>It seems unlikely that reintroducing a species like the dire wolf is an end game project for the company, but one that is interesting enough to attract the attention of the public and investors, upon whose support all future ventures will no doubt rely.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_765304" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-765304" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-765304 size-large" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/a-pack-of-wolves-in-the-forest_Ondrej-Chvatal_Shutterstock-800x540.jpg" alt="a pack of wolves in the forest" width="800" height="540" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/a-pack-of-wolves-in-the-forest_Ondrej-Chvatal_Shutterstock-800x540.jpg.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/a-pack-of-wolves-in-the-forest_Ondrej-Chvatal_Shutterstock-600x405.jpg.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/a-pack-of-wolves-in-the-forest_Ondrej-Chvatal_Shutterstock-768x518.jpg.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/a-pack-of-wolves-in-the-forest_Ondrej-Chvatal_Shutterstock-250x169.jpg.webp 250w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/a-pack-of-wolves-in-the-forest_Ondrej-Chvatal_Shutterstock.jpg.webp 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-765304" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Ondrej Chvatal, Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>What Are the Implications of De-Extinction?</h2>\n<p>It would be easy to be caught up in the possibilities and potential of de-extinction, not only from an ecological perspective but also from an evolutionary one.</p>\n<div class="su-quote su-quote-style-default su-quote-has-cite"><div class="su-quote-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim">Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn&#8217;t stop to think if they should.<span class="su-quote-cite"> Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park</span></div></div>\n<h3>Where do they go?</h3>\n<p>The extinction of a species doesn’t happen in isolation, particularly when we are talking about an apex predator or an important prey species. When their numbers dwindle, the species around them will prosper or suffer as a result, something that is not always considered. <em>How would today’s ecosystem cope with the reintroduction of the dire wolf?</em></p>\n<p>Even those species whose more recent extinction has been at the hands of modern humans may find themselves unable to reintegrate into a habitat or food chain that has adjusted to their absence. And certainly, we cannot hope to bring back such animals before first addressing the issues that wiped them from the planet in the first place.</p>\n<h3>Who do they belong to?</h3>\n<p>When a private company is behind the recreation – or indeed, creation – of an animal species, do they own the rights to that animal? Could such ownership rights outweigh the rights and welfare of the animals themselves? And how long before curious geneticists or exploitative capitalists start experimenting with interspecies hybridization?</p>\n<p>It seems that as technology advances, the line between science and science fiction becomes less distinct, and the films we once suspended reality to enjoy may become cautionary tales.</p>\n<p>The problem inherent in privately funded scientific advancement is that its continued existence and progress depend greatly on its ability to attract and retain investors. And for every entrepreneur and philanthropist who seeks to support and preserve ecological diversity, there will be another who is just as keen to exploit it. Recreating an ambassador species like the dire wolf to generate support for conservation research is understandable, but it is a door, once opened, that will be very hard to close, especially once dinosaurs start coming through it.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this cynic has just watched too many Jurassic Park films, but if it’s a choice between caution and restraint over an <em>Indominus Rex</em>,  I know which one I’m choosing.</p>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/barking-news/de-extinction-of-the-dire-wolf">De-Extinction of the Dire Wolf &#8211; Brave New World or Colossal Mistake?</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-karyn-kanowski">Dr. Karyn Kanowski, BVSc MRCVS (Vet)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.

It is very important to understand that this column is not an <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/when-to-take-dog-to-emergency-vet" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">emergency service</a>. It may take weeks before Dr. Paola sees your questions, and she does not answer every one.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This week, we have answered a very distressing question for the purposes of education. Please note this as a trigger warning, and take the information below as a preventative and safety measure.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Situations involving potential ingestion of batteries or electrical components typically require immediate veterinary attention. </strong>When in doubt, <a href="https://pangovet.com/?utm_source=dogster&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=ask-dr-paola-in-content/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">an online veterinary service like our own PangoVet</a> can be a helpful first step to assess the urgency and guide your next move.</p>\n<h3>Help! My Dog Ate String Lights</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Dear Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>My chihuahua, Darby, is 11 pounds and ate a string of mini battery-operated Christmas lights. They were on when he ate them, and he rubbed his face on the ground and had white foam flying out of his mouth and was nervous and confused and kept shaking his head violently and trotting around and rubbing his sides of face and looked scared and worried and sad, I&#8217;m going to give him a Vaseline sandwich or cotton.” </strong>&#8211; Kelly</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Kelly,</p>\n<p>Thank you for reaching out with your concern about Darby. What you described is deeply concerning and may represent a very serious situation.</p>\n<p>If Darby chewed or swallowed battery-operated Christmas lights while they were on, this could expose him to <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/how-to-treat-a-dog-burn" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">electrical burns</a>, damage from sharp plastic or wire, and even chemical injury if the batteries leaked. The signs you noticed, such as a foamy mouth, confusion, head shaking, and rubbing his face, suggest he could be in pain or already experiencing injury to his mouth or throat.</p>\n<p>Given the nature of what he ingested, there is also a very real concern for early involvement of the <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/neurological-disorders-in-dogs-vet-answer" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">central nervous system</a>. Confusion and disoriented behavior can sometimes reflect systemic effects from pain, chemical exposure, or electrical injury, all of which are possible if a battery or live wiring was chewed. These signs should not be taken lightly, as they may signal more than just local irritation; they could be the first signs of a progressing, potentially life-threatening condition. <strong>Giving him a <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/is-vaseline-safe-for-dogs" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Vaseline</a> sandwich or cotton is not safe in this context and could cause more harm or delay the urgent care he may need.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Situations involving potential ingestion of batteries or electrical components typically require immediate veterinary attention.</strong> When in doubt, an <a href="https://pangovet.com/?utm_source=dogster&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=ask-dr-paola-in-content/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">online veterinary service like our own PangoVet</a> can be a helpful first step to assess the urgency and guide your next move.</p>\n<p>However, in Darby’s case, based on the information you provided, it is best to take him to an emergency veterinary clinic right away to ensure he receives the care he needs as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>I hope he is well,</p>\n<p>Dr.

Ear polyps in dogs can be uncomfortable, especially if they cause irritation, discharge, or <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/dog-ear-infections" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">recurrent infections</a>. While they’re usually benign, they often continue to grow if left untreated, which can lead to more discomfort or complications over time. The ideal solution is <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/how-to-prepare-your-dog-for-surgery" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">surgical removal</a>, both to relieve Lexi’s discomfort and to confirm the growth is not something more serious. However, I understand that <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/my-dog-needs-surgery-and-i-cant-afford-it" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">cost can be a real barrier</a>.</p>\n<p>One option to consider is reaching out to local veterinary schools or nonprofit veterinary clinics, as they often provide care at a reduced cost. You might also check with local animal welfare organizations, some of which <a href="https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/organizations-that-help-with-vet-bills" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">offer financial assistanc</a>e or can direct you to low-cost services. In the meantime, keeping Lexi comfortable is important. If there&#8217;s any visible discharge or irritation, gently cleaning the outer ear with a pet-safe saline solution and a soft cloth can help reduce debris buildup. Avoid inserting anything into the ear canal or using products not prescribed specifically for him, as that could cause more harm. The goal right now is to minimize inflammation and discomfort while you look into support options. Sometimes, just explaining the situation to a few local clinics can lead to <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/dog-health-crisis-expensive-help-paying-vet-bills-pet-care-tips" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">payment plans or reduced rates</a>, especially if they see that Lexi is otherwise well cared for. I hope this helps!</p>\n<p>Dr. Paola</p>\n<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716646" style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;" src="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp" alt="divider dog paws 2 oct 2024" width="2560" height="308" srcset="https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-scaled.webp 2560w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-600x72.webp 600w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-800x96.webp 800w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-768x92.webp 768w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-1536x185.webp 1536w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-2048x246.webp 2048w, https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dogster_Website-dividers_v1_Oct-1-2024-05-250x30.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>\n<h3>Help! My Dog Has a Torn CCL!</h3>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Hi Dr. Paola,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>My active, 70 lb, 8.5-year-old Lab mix Allie had successful FHO when he was 1.5 years old. Now she limps on that leg. Vet says it is torn CCL and recommends TPLO. I am concerned that the femur is not stable enough since it is no longer in the hip socket and will slide. Also, how could she get torn CCL if there is no stress of femur on tibia due to femur&#8217;s flexibility?&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Tad</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hi Tad,<br />\nThank you for providing such a thoughtful question. It’s completely understandable to be concerned about Allie’s limb stability given her surgical history. A femoral head ostectomy (FHO) does change the way the weight is transferred through the hind limb, but it doesn’t eliminate all forces on the stifle (knee) joint. After an FHO, the femur no longer articulates directly with the acetabulum, but over time, a fibrous pseudo-joint forms that allows a relatively functional range of motion. While this alters the mechanics in the hip, the stifle joint still bears significant force during weight-bearing, particularly during active movement like running, turning, or jumping. These activities can still place stress on the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL), especially in an athletic or older dog.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-the-vet/torn-acl-in-dogs-vet-answer" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">A torn CCL</a> in a dog like Allie is unfortunately not uncommon, even in a limb that has undergone FHO. The FHO does not remove the femur&#8217;s role in transmitting load to the tibia. Instead, the altered mechanics and long-term compensation patterns may actually increase strain on the knee over time. Regarding your concern about Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy (TPLO), it is a valid question. Surgeons take previous orthopedic procedures into account when evaluating candidacy. TPLO changes the angle of the tibial plateau to neutralize the shear forces that lead to instability when the CCL is torn. It can still be effective in dogs with a prior FHO, depending on the individual case. A second opinion from a veterinary <a href="https://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/what-is-a-veterinary-specialist" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">orthopedic surgeon</a> may provide more clarity on whether TPLO is the best option, or if alternatives like Tibial Tuberosity Advancement (TTA) or conservative management are more suitable based on Allie’s muscle condition, gait, and comfort level.</p>\n<p>It’s nice to read that you are clearly focused on her long-term well-being and want to be well-informed. With her being so active and already compensating for a modified hip, ensuring the stability of her stifle is essential to protect her overall mobility and prevent additional strain on the rest of her body. I hope she gets the very best treatment!</p>\n<p>&#8211; Dr. Paola</p>\n<div class="su-box su-box-style-default" id="" style="border-color:#004288;border-radius:3px"><div class="su-box-title" style="background-color:#2575bb;color:#FFFFFF;border-top-left-radius:1px;border-top-right-radius:1px">This article is a part of our weekly Ask Dr. Paola series</div><div class="su-box-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim" style="border-bottom-left-radius:1px;border-bottom-right-radius:1px"><div class="su-list" style="margin-left:0px">\n<ul>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong>View past week&#8217;s questions here: <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola/monday-april-14-2025" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">April 14, 2025</a></strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola#Past_Articles" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">See our full list of past articles here</a></strong></li>\n<li><i class="sui sui-star" style="color:#F4B242"></i> <strong><a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank">Click here</a> to submit a question</strong> </div></div></div></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href="https://www.dogster.com/ask-dr-paola/monday-april-21-2025">Ask Dr. Paola: Monday April 21, 2025</a> by <a href="https://www.dogster.com/author/dr-paola-cuevas">Dr. Paola Cuevas MVZ (Vet)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.dogster.com">Dogster</a>.
